## 💡 Use Cases

### E-commerce Scraping
```python
# Extract product information
prompt = "Extract product names, prices, and availability"
```

### Content Aggregation
```python
# Convert articles to structured data
prompt = "Extract article title, author, date, and main content"
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Local Library
1. You provide your OpenAI API key
2. Select the model (GPT-4o, GPT-5, or local models)
3. Enter the URL and extraction prompt
4. The app uses ScrapeGraphAI to scrape and extract data locally
5. Results are displayed in the app

### Cloud SDK
1. You provide your ScrapeGraph AI API key
2. Choose the scraping method (SmartScraper, SearchScraper, etc.)
3. Define extraction prompt and optional output schema
4. API processes the request in the cloud
5. Structured results are returned
