# ðŸŽ® AI 3D PyGame Visualizer with DeepSeek R1
This Project demonstrates R1's code capabilities with a PyGame code generator and visualizer with browser use. The system uses DeepSeek for reasoning, OpenAI for code extraction, and browser automation agents to visualize the code on Trinket.io.

### Features

- Generates PyGame code from natural language descriptions
- Uses DeepSeek Reasoner for code logic and explanation
- Extracts clean code using OpenAI GPT-4o
- Automates code visualization on Trinket.io using browser agents
- Provides a streamlined Streamlit interface
- Multi-agent system for handling different tasks (navigation, coding, execution, viewing)

### How to get Started?

1. Clone the GitHub repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
cd awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_tutorials/ai_3dpygame_r1
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get your API Keys
- Sign up for [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/) and obtain your API key
- Sign up for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and obtain your API key

4. Run the AI PyGame Visualizer
```bash
streamlit run ai_3dpygame_r1.py
```

5. Browser use automatically opens your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the console output to interact with the PyGame generator.

### How it works?

1. **Query Processing:** User enters a natural language description of the desired PyGame visualization.
2. **Code Generation:** 
   - DeepSeek Reasoner analyzes the query and provides detailed reasoning with code
   - OpenAI agent extracts clean, executable code from the reasoning
3. **Visualization:**
   - Browser agents automate the process of running code on Trinket.io
   - Multiple specialized agents handle different tasks:
     - Navigation to Trinket.io
     - Code input
     - Execution
     - Visualization viewing
4. **User Interface:** Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for entering queries, viewing code, and managing the visualization process.
