- **Memory**: Conversation memory for personalized recommendations
- **Tools**: Custom tools for recipe search and analysis + DuckDuckGo web search
- **Interface**: Streamlit web application

### Custom Tools
1. `search_recipes(ingredients, diet_type=None)` - Recipe discovery via Spoonacular API with detailed instructions
2. `analyze_nutrition(recipe_name)` - Detailed nutritional analysis via Spoonacular
3. `estimate_costs(ingredients, servings=4)` - Budget planning and cost estimation
4. `create_meal_plan(dietary_preference="balanced", people=2, days=7, budget="moderate")` - Comprehensive weekly meal planning with shopping list
5. `DuckDuckGoTools` - Web search for additional context

### Key Technologies
- **Agno**: AI agent framework
- **Streamlit**: Web interface and user interaction
- **Spoonacular API**: Recipe and nutrition data
- **OpenAI GPT-5 mini**: Natural language understanding and generation

## Customization

### Adding New Dietary Preferences
Modify the `search_recipes` tool to include additional diet types supported by Spoonacular API.

### Extending Cost Database
Update the `ingredient_costs` dictionary in `estimate_grocery_costs()` with local pricing.

### Custom Meal Categories
Edit the `meal_categories` in `create_weekly_meal_plan()` to match your preferences.

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues:**
- Ensure your `.env` file is in the correct directory
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
- Check API key format (no extra spaces or quotes)
 - Note: Without `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY`, recipe search and nutrition tools will return an error; other features will still load.

**Recipe Search Not Working:**
- Verify Spoonacular API key is set correctly
- Check your API usage limits (150 requests/day for free tier)
- Try simpler ingredient searches

**Memory Issues:**
- The agent uses conversation memory to remember preferences
- Clear browser cache if experiencing persistent issues
- Restart the application to reset conversation history
