  - **DeepSeek Reasoner**: Provides initial technical analysis and structured reasoning about architecture patterns, tools, and implementation strategies
  - **Claude-3.5**: Generates detailed explanations, implementation roadmaps, and technical specifications based on DeepSeek's analysis

- **Comprehensive Analysis Components**
  - Architecture Pattern Selection
  - Infrastructure Resource Planning
  - Security Measures and Compliance
  - Database Architecture
  - Performance Requirements
  - Cost Estimation
  - Risk Assessment

- **Analysis Types**
  - Real-time Event Processing Systems
  - Healthcare Data Platforms
  - Financial Trading Platforms
  - Multi-tenant SaaS Solutions
  - Digital Content Delivery Networks
  - Supply Chain Management Systems

## Example Test Prompts:

### 1. Financial Trading Platform
"We need to build a high-frequency trading platform that processes market data streams, executes trades with sub-millisecond latency, maintains audit trails, and handles complex risk calculations. The system needs to be globally distributed, handle 100,000 transactions per second, and have robust disaster recovery capabilities."
### 2. Multi-tenant SaaS Platform
"Design a multi-tenant SaaS platform for enterprise resource planning that needs to support customization per tenant, handle different data residency requirements, support offline capabilities, and maintain performance isolation between tenants. The system should scale to 10,000 concurrent users and support custom integrations."

## Notes

- Requires both DeepSeek and Anthropic API keys
- Provides real-time analysis with detailed explanations
- Supports chat-based interaction
- Includes clear reasoning for all architectural decisions
- API usage costs apply
