## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

- **"Error: [error message]"**: Check your internet connection and API keys
  - Verify both OpenAI and Google Maps API keys are entered correctly
  - Try again in a few minutes - the MCP servers may be temporarily unavailable

- **Missing distance information**: Google Maps MCP connection issue
  - Check your Google Maps API key validity
  - Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions for Maps API
  - Try refreshing the page and entering the keys again

- **Slow response times**: MCP servers can take time to respond
  - The app has a 60-second timeout configured
  - Wait for the process to complete - detailed itineraries take time to generate

- **Network/Firewall issues**: Some corporate networks may block MCP connections
  - Try from a different network
  - Use a VPN if necessary
  - The app will show connection errors if MCP servers are unreachable

### API Key Issues

- **OpenAI API Key**: Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account and the key is valid
- **Google Maps API Key**: Ensure the key has Maps API enabled and proper billing setup

### Tool Status

The app will show you which data sources were successfully used:
- üè® **"Your travel itinerary is ready with Airbnb data!"** = Airbnb MCP connected successfully
- üìù **"Used general knowledge for accommodation suggestions"** = Airbnb MCP failed, using general knowledge as fallback

**The app is designed to work reliably!** Even if MCP connections fail, it will generate comprehensive itineraries using available tools and information.
