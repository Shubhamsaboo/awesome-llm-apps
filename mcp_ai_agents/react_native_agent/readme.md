# React Native MCP Agent

This project is an AI agent designed to interact with React Native applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables advanced automation, reasoning, and integration capabilities for mobile app workflows.

## Features

- MCP server for agent communication
- Native integration with React Native apps
- Extensible agent logic in Python
- Example usage and quickstart scripts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- React Native development environment
- Node.js and npm

### Installation

1. Add the React Native MCP agent to your project:
   ```bash
   npm install @mcp/react-native-agent
   ```

2. No external dependencies required for core MCP server 

### Usage

1. Import the agent in your React Native application:
   ```javascript
   import { MCPAgent } from '@mcp/react-native-agent';
   ```

2. Initialize the agent:
   ```javascript
   const agent = new MCPAgent();
   await agent.initialize();
   ```

3. Execute commands:
   ```javascript
   const result = await agent.execute('analyze-screen');
   ```

- For native integration, see `native.py` for example functions and usage.

## File Structure

- `mcp_server.py` — MCP server implementation
- `native.py` — Native React Native integration logic

## Customization

- Extend `native.py` for additional React Native features.
