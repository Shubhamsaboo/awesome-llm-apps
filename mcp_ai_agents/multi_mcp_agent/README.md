## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
   cd awesome-llm-apps/mcp_ai_agents/multi_mcp_agent
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Verify Node.js installation** (required for MCP servers):
    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    npx --version
    ```
    If Node.js is not installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

4. **Set up your API keys**:
    Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-github-token
    PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key
    ```

    - Get an OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
    - Get a GitHub Personal Access Token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens (with `repo`, `user`, and `admin:org` scopes)
    - Get a Perplexity API key from: https://www.perplexity.ai/
    - Configure OpenAI MCP Headers according to your setup requirements

5. **Run the Multi-MCP Agent**:
    ```bash
    python multi_mcp_agent.py
    ```

6. **Start Interacting**:
    - The assistant will validate your environment variables
    - Generate unique user and session IDs
    - Initialize connections to all MCP servers
    - Start the interactive CLI interface

## Usage

1. **Environment Validation**: The assistant automatically checks for all required API keys and environment variables
2. **Session Management**: Each session gets unique user and session IDs for tracking and context
3. **Interactive Commands**: Use natural language to interact with integrated services:

### Example Commands

**GitHub Operations**:
- "Show my recent GitHub repositories"
- "Create a new issue in my project repo"
- "Search for Python code in my repositories"
- "Review the latest pull requests"

**Research & Information**:
- "Search for the latest AI developments"
- "What are the trending topics in machine learning?"
- "Find documentation for FastAPI"
- "Research best practices for microservices"

**Calendar Management**:
- "Schedule a meeting for next week"
- "Show my upcoming appointments"
- "Find available time slots for a 2-hour meeting"

**Cross-Platform Workflows**:
- "Create a GitHub issue and schedule a follow-up meeting"
- "Research a topic and create a summary document"
- "Find trending repositories and add them to my watchlist"

4. **Session Control**: Type 'exit', 'quit', or 'bye' to end the session

## Architecture

The Multi-MCP Agent leverages:
- **Agno Framework**: For agent orchestration and tool management
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: As the core language model
- **MCP Servers**: For external service integrations
- **Async Architecture**: For efficient concurrent operations
- **Memory System**: For context retention and conversation history

## Note

The assistant connects to multiple MCP servers using Node.js packages. Ensure you have a stable internet connection and valid API keys for all services. The tool chaining capabilities allow for complex workflows that span multiple platforms, making it a powerful productivity multiplier for developers and professionals.
