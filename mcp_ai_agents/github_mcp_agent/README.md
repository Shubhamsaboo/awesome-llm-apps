- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for MCP GitHub server)
  - This is a critical requirement! The app uses `npx` to run the MCP GitHub server
  - Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
