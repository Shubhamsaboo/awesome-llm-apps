**What it Does:**

This application functions as an AI-driven tarot reader. It takes natural language input and, using an AI model guided by traditional tarot card meanings, provides interpretative insights.


**Key Features:**

* **Natural Language Support:** Understands and interacts in natural language (currently configured for English).
* **Local AI Model ('phi4'):** Runs on the efficient 'phi4' model, ideal for local processing and privacy.
* **CSV-driven Knowledge Base:** Utilizes structured CSV files to store and reference detailed tarot card meanings and symbolism (currently using `data/tarots.csv` with English content).
* **Deep Insights:** Transforms raw text queries into meaningful, context-aware interpretations based on tarot symbolism.

**How it Works:**

The core of The Magician IA Reader lies in its use of the 'phi4' local AI model. This model is fine-tuned or prompted using comprehensive data from CSV files, which contain the interpretations for each tarot card. When a user provides text input, the application processes it through the AI, which then generates a response informed by the tarot meanings.

**Why Use It?**

* **Researchers & Developers:** Explore the capabilities of local AI models for natural language understanding and generation.
* **AI Enthusiasts:** Experiment with a practical application of AI in a unique domain.
* **Curious Minds:** Experience an innovative way to interact with AI for personal insights.

Step into the world where AI meets intuition with The Magician IA Reader!
