> **Stop using generic models. Start training AI that understands your workflow.**

Aquin transforms local LLM development by combining **fine-tuning, RAG, and rich integrations** - letting you create custom AI models trained on your data, your context, and your coding style in just 2-3 minutes.

## 🎯 **The Problem We Solve**

### Before Aquin:

- ❌ **Generic Responses**: Pre-trained models don't understand your specific domain
- ❌ **Complex Setup**: Fine-tuning requires ML expertise and infrastructure
- ❌ **Slow Training**: Hours or days to train custom models
- ❌ **Limited Context**: Can't leverage your files, emails, or browsing history
- ❌ **Cloud Dependency**: Privacy concerns with uploading sensitive data
- ❌ **Expensive Hardware**: Need to rent GPUs or cloud resources

### With Aquin:

- ✅ **Domain-Specific AI**: Models trained on your exact use case
- ✅ **2-3 Minute Training**: Fast fine-tuning with LoRA and QLoRA
- ✅ **Rich Context Integration**: Connect Gmail, Drive, Browser, and more
- ✅ **Complete Privacy**: Everything runs locally on your machine
- ✅ **Flexible Training**: Fine-tuning, LoRA, QLoRA, or RAG - your choice
- ✅ **Auto Formatting**: AI handles data preparation automatically

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### 🧠 **Advanced ML Methods, Simplified**

#### **Fine-Tuning**

- Update all model weights for maximum customization
- Full control over model behavior and responses
- Best for domain-specific applications

#### **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

- Efficient training: ΔW = B × A
- Reduce training time by 70%
- Lower memory requirements

#### **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)**

- Quantization + Low-Rank Adaptation
- Run on consumer GPUs (RTX 4090 recommended)
- Same performance, fraction of the resources

#### **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**

- Works with third-party LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Long-term memory and large context handling
- No training required - instant context injection

### 📊 **Train in Any Format**

Automatic formatting with AI - just provide your data:

- **JSON**: Structured arrays with metadata and nested properties
- **JSONL**: Streaming-friendly, one object per line
- **CSV**: Simple spreadsheet format with headers
- **TXT**: Plain text with custom delimiters

### 🔗 **Strong Memory & Context Handling**

#### **LLM Provider Integration**

- **Hugging Face**: Browse, download, and train any model
- **Anthropic**: Claude models with powerful RAG
- **Ollama**: Connect to local models seamlessly

#### **System & Google Connections**

- **File Manager MCP**: Complete path management and context
- **Clipboard**: System clipboard history as training data
- **Browser History**: Use browsing context for personalization
- **Gmail**: Email content as training context
- **Google Calendar**: Event data integration
- **Google Drive**: Import files directly

### 🎨 **Developer-Focused Editor**

- Rich integrations with your existing workflow
- Project discussion and research notes in one place
- Real-time training monitoring
- Customizable hardware specs (VRAM, RAM, CPU cores)

### ⚡ **Blazing Fast Training**

- **2-3 minute** training time for most models
- No lagging during inference
- Scales to lower-end hardware with QLoRA

## 💡 **How It Works**

### 1. **Prepare Your Dataset**

- Upload files in JSON, JSONL, CSV, or TXT format
- Or connect integrations (Gmail, Drive, Browser)
- AI automatically formats and validates your data

### 2. **Choose Your Training Method**

- **Fine-Tuning**: Full model customization
- **LoRA**: Fast, efficient adaptation
- **QLoRA**: Memory-efficient quantized training
- **RAG**: No training, instant context retrieval

### 3. **Configure Hardware**

- Set VRAM allocation
- Adjust batch size and learning rate
- Monitor GPU usage in real-time

### 4. **Train in Minutes**

- Click "Start Training"
- Watch progress in the editor
- 2-3 minutes for most LoRA/QLoRA jobs
- Save checkpoints automatically

### 5. **Deploy & Use**

- Test in the integrated chat interface
- Export model for production use
- Share with your team
- Continue training with new data
