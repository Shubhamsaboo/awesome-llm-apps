## Component Details



The "Multi-Component Platform (MCP) Agent Applications" subsystem is a collection of specialized AI agents designed to perform complex, multi-step tasks by leveraging a modular and collaborative framework. The core idea is to enable different agents to work together, often interacting with external services or platforms.



### Multi MCP Agent

This component serves as the foundational or generic multi-component agent. It likely provides the core framework and utilities for building other MCP agents, handling inter-agent communication, and managing the lifecycle of a multi-agent system. It acts as a base for specialized agents to build upon.

### AI Travel Planner MCP Agent Team

This component represents a collaborative team of agents specifically designed for travel planning. It orchestrates various sub-agents (e.g., for itinerary generation, booking, and calendar management) to provide a comprehensive travel planning solution.
