## Example

**User Request:** "Write a LinkedIn post about staying productive while working remotely"

**Response:**

```
I used to think productivity meant working 12-hour days.

Then remote work taught me something different.

Last year, I worked from home for 230 days. Here's what actually kept me productive (it's not what you think):

**1. Start with friction**
Don't check email first thing. Your morning energy is precious - use it for deep work, not inbox triage.

I write code or create content between 9-11am. No Slack, no email, no meetings.

**2. Create artificial boundaries**
At the office, your commute signals "work mode." At home, you need new triggers.

Mine: Change clothes. Sounds simple, but pajamas = brain says "relax mode."

**3. Embrace the async**
Your coworkers don't need you instantly available. 

Set 2-3 "sync windows" daily for meetings/Slack. Rest of the time? Notifications off. Deep work on.

**4. Physical movement breaks**
Sitting = new smoking. Every 90 minutes, move your body.

My rule: Can't start next task until I've walked around the block. Non-negotiable.

**5. Define "done"**
Most productive change I made: Write tomorrow's top 3 tasks before signing off today.

Waking up without a plan = scattered energy. Waking up with clarity = momentum.

**The paradox of remote productivity:**

Less time "at work" 
= More actual work done
= Better work-life balance
