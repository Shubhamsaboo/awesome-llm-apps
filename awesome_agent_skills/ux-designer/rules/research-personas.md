# Rule: Creating Effective Personas

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Category:** User Research

## Description

Personas are archetypal representations of user groups, grounded in research data. They guide design decisions by keeping the team focused on real user needs.

## Guidelines

### Creation Process
1. Conduct user interviews and gather behavioral data
2. Identify patterns in goals, behaviors, and pain points
3. Cluster users into 3-5 distinct groups
4. Draft persona profiles based on data patterns
5. Validate personas with additional research or stakeholder input
6. Share personas with the full team and refer to them by name in discussions

### What to Include
- **Name and photo:** Makes the persona feel real and memorable
- **Goals:** What they're trying to accomplish (both functional and emotional)
- **Pain points:** Current frustrations and unmet needs
- **Behaviors:** How they currently solve the problem, tools they use
- **Context:** When, where, and why they interact with the product
- **Quote:** A representative statement that captures their mindset

### What to Avoid
- Demographics without behavioral data (age and income alone don't drive design decisions)
- Aspirational personas (who you wish your users were, not who they are)
- Too many personas (more than 5 dilutes team focus)
- Generic personas that could describe anyone

## Examples

### Good
```markdown
## Sarah, The Busy Parent
**Age:** 34 | **Occupation:** Marketing Manager | **Location:** Austin, TX

### Goals
- Order groceries in under 10 minutes during her commute
- Never run out of essentials (milk, diapers, snacks)
- Stay within her weekly grocery budget of $150

### Pain Points
- Hates scrolling through irrelevant promotions to find basics
- Forgets items because she can't easily reorder past purchases
- Delivery windows are too broad — needs precision for her schedule

### Behaviors
- Shops on her phone, never desktop
- Reorders 70% of the same items weekly
- Compares prices across 2 apps before committing

> "I just need the basics fast. Don't make me think about groceries more than I have to."
```

### Bad
```markdown
## User Type A
**Age:** 25-45 | **Gender:** Any | **Income:** Middle class

### Goals
- Wants a good experience
- Likes easy-to-use apps

[Too vague to inform any design decision]
```

## Common Mistakes
- Creating personas in a brainstorming session without research
- Updating personas only once and never revisiting them
- Making personas but never referencing them in design reviews
- Confusing personas with market segments
