# Rule: Visual Hierarchy Principles

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Visual Design

## Description

Visual hierarchy directs user attention and communicates the relative importance of elements on a screen. A strong hierarchy means users instinctively know where to look and what to do.

## Guidelines

### Establishing Hierarchy
1. **Size:** Larger elements attract attention first; use for headings and primary CTAs
2. **Contrast:** High contrast draws the eye; use for key actions and critical information
3. **Color:** Saturated or brand colors for emphasis; muted tones for secondary elements
4. **Position:** Top-left scanned first (LTR languages); place key content in the F-pattern or Z-pattern
5. **Whitespace:** Generous spacing isolates and elevates important elements
6. **Typography:** Weight, size, and style create clear content levels

### Typography Scale
- Limit to 3-4 distinct text sizes per screen
- Maintain a consistent ratio between levels (1.25x or 1.333x scale)
- Use weight (bold vs. regular) to differentiate within the same size
- Reserve ALL CAPS for very short labels only (buttons, tags)

### Color Usage
- Primary color for main CTAs and key interactive elements
- Neutral colors (grays) for body text and secondary elements
- Semantic colors for feedback: green (success), red (error), yellow (warning), blue (info)
- Limit accent colors to 1-2 per screen to maintain focus

### Layout Principles
- Align to a consistent grid (8px base unit is standard)
- Use consistent spacing between related elements (tighter) vs. unrelated elements (looser)
- Group related items visually using proximity and shared containers
- Leave breathing room — cramped layouts increase cognitive load

## Common Mistakes
- Making everything bold or large (if everything is emphasized, nothing is)
- Using too many colors without clear purpose
- Inconsistent spacing that makes the layout feel chaotic
- Competing CTAs of equal visual weight on the same screen
- Decorative elements that distract from content and actions
