# Rule: Conducting User Interviews

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Category:** User Research

## Description

User interviews are the foundation of evidence-based design. This rule ensures interviews yield actionable insights rather than confirmation of assumptions.

## Guidelines

### Planning
- Define clear research objectives before scheduling interviews
- Write a discussion guide with 8-12 open-ended questions
- Recruit 5-8 participants per round for qualitative insights
- Screen participants to match your target user profile
- Schedule 45-60 minutes per session (30 min interview + buffer)

### During the Interview
- Start with easy warm-up questions to build rapport
- Ask about past behavior, not hypothetical future behavior
- Use "Tell me about a time when..." framing
- Follow up with "Why?" and "Can you show me?" prompts
- Stay silent after asking — let the participant fill the space
- Take notes on observations, not just words

### After the Interview
- Debrief within 24 hours while memory is fresh
- Tag and categorize key quotes and observations
- Use affinity mapping to cluster findings into themes
- Distinguish between what users say vs. what they do
- Prioritize findings by frequency and severity

## Examples

### Good
```
Interviewer: "Walk me through the last time you tried to book a flight online."
Participant: [describes experience with specific details]
Interviewer: "You mentioned you got frustrated at the seat selection. What happened?"
```

### Bad
```
Interviewer: "Would you like it if we added a feature that shows seat maps?"
Participant: "Sure, that sounds nice."
[This tells you nothing about actual behavior or real needs]
```

## Common Mistakes
- Asking leading questions that suggest the "right" answer
- Interviewing only power users and missing beginner perspectives
- Not recording sessions (with consent) for team review
- Jumping to solutions during the interview instead of exploring the problem
- Treating a single participant's feedback as representative of all users
