# Rule: Content Organization

**Priority:** HIGH
**Category:** Information Architecture

## Description

How content is structured and grouped directly affects whether users can find what they need and complete their tasks efficiently.

## Guidelines

### Organizational Principles
- **User-centric grouping:** Organize by user goals, not business departments
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show only what's needed at each level; reveal details on demand
- **Consistency:** Same type of content should appear in the same location across pages
- **Scannability:** Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and visual breaks

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Page title:** What is this page about? (one per page)
2. **Section headings:** Major content groups
3. **Supporting content:** Details within each section
4. **Related content:** Cross-links and supplementary information
5. **Metadata:** Dates, authors, categories, tags

### Information Scent
- Labels should clearly indicate what users will find behind them
- Preview content where possible (descriptions, thumbnails, counts)
- Use "trigger words" that match user vocabulary and search terms
- Provide visual cues for content types (icons for video, PDF, external links)

### Card Sorting for Validation
- **Open sort:** Participants group items and name the categories (discovery phase)
- **Closed sort:** Participants sort items into predefined categories (validation phase)
- Run with 15-20 participants for reliable patterns
- Use results to validate or restructure your information architecture

## Common Mistakes
- Mirroring the database structure in the UI
- Using the same label for different things in different contexts
- Burying important content below the fold on key pages
- Creating deep hierarchies when a flat structure would be clearer
- Not accounting for content that belongs in multiple categories
