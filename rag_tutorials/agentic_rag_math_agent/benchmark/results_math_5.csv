"Let $-\frac{\pi}{6}<\theta<-\frac{\pi}{12}$. Suppose $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$ and $\alpha_{2}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2}+2 x \tan \theta-1=0$. If $\alpha_{1}>\beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}>\beta_{2}$, then $\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}$ equals

(A) $2(\sec \theta-\tan \theta)$

(B) $2 \sec \theta$

(C) $-2 \tan \theta$

(D) 0",C,"To find the values of $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$, we need to solve the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$. This is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, where $a=1$, $b=-2\sec\theta$, and $c=1$. 

The roots of a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$. 

For the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$, we have $a=1$, $b=-2\sec\theta$, and $c=1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$\alpha_{1}=\frac{2\sec\theta+\sqrt{4\sec^{2}\theta-4}}{2}=\sec\theta+\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta-1}$

$\beta_{1}=\frac{2\sec\theta-\sqrt{4\sec^{2}\theta-4}}{2}=\sec\theta-\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta-1}$

Since $\alpha_{1}>\beta_{1}$, we have $\sec\theta+\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta-1}>\sec\theta-\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta-1}$. 

Now, to find the values of $\alpha_{2}$ and $\beta_{2}$, we need to solve the equation $x^{2}+2 x \tan \theta-1=0$. This is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, where $a=1$, $b=2\tan\theta$, and $c=-1$. 

Using the quadratic formula, we find:

$\alpha_{2}=\frac{-2\tan\theta+\sqrt{4\tan^{2}\theta+4}}{2}=-\tan\theta+\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1}$

$\beta_{2}=\frac{-2\tan\theta-\sqrt{4\tan^{2}\theta+4}}{2}=-\tan\theta-\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1}$

Since $\alpha_{2}>\beta_{2}$, we have $-\tan\theta+\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1}>-\tan\theta-\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1}$. 

Finally, we need to find $\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}$. Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

$\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}=(\sec\theta+\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta-1})+(-\tan\theta-\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1})$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}=\sec\theta-\tan\theta$

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{C) -2\tan\theta}$.",True,9.85
"A debate club consists of 6 girls and 4 boys. A team of 4 members is to be selected from this club including the selection of a captain (from among these 4 members) for the team. If the team has to include at most one boy, then the number of ways of selecting the team is

(A) 380

(B) 320

(C) 260

(D) 95",A,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios for selecting the team with at most one boy.

1. Selecting a team with no boys:
In this case, we need to select 4 girls from the 6 available girls. This can be done in 6 choose 4 ways, which is equal to 15 ways.

2. Selecting a team with one boy:
We can select 1 boy from the 4 available boys and 3 girls from the 6 available girls. This can be done in 4 choose 1 * 6 choose 3 ways, which is equal to 80 ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways of selecting the team with at most one boy is the sum of the ways from the two scenarios:
15 (from scenario 1) + 80 (from scenario 2) = 95 ways.

So, the correct answer is (D) 95.",True,4.15
"Let $S=\left\{x \in(-\pi, \pi): x \neq 0, \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\right\}$. The sum of all distinct solutions of the equation $\sqrt{3} \sec x+\operatorname{cosec} x+2(\tan x-\cot x)=0$ in the set $S$ is equal to

(A) $-\frac{7 \pi}{9}$

(B) $-\frac{2 \pi}{9}$

(C) 0

(D) $\frac{5 \pi}{9}$",C,"To find the sum of all distinct solutions of the given equation in the set $S$, we first need to simplify the equation.

Given equation: $\sqrt{3} \sec x+\csc x+2(\tan x-\cot x)=0$

Recall that $\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}$ and $\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$.

Substitute these values into the equation:
$\sqrt{3} \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} - \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}) = 0$

Simplify the equation:
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x}) = 0$

$\frac{\sqrt{3}\sin x + \cos x}{\sin x \cos x} + 2(\frac{\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x}) = 0$

$\frac{\sqrt{3}\sin x + \cos x + 2\sin^2 x - 2\cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = 0$

$\frac{2\sin^2 x + \sqrt{3}\sin x - 2\cos^2 x + \cos x}{\sin x \cos x} = 0$

Now, we need to find the solutions of this equation in the set $S$, which is $(-\pi, \pi)$ excluding $0, \pm \frac{\pi}{2}$.

By solving the equation and considering the restrictions, we find that the distinct solutions in the set $S$ are $x = \frac{5\pi}{6}$ and $x = -\frac{\pi}{6}$.

Therefore, the sum of all distinct solutions in the set $S$ is $\frac{5\pi}{6} + (-\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{4\pi}{6} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$.

"A computer producing factory has only two plants $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$. Plant $T_{1}$ produces $20 \%$ and plant $T_{2}$ produces $80 \%$ of the total computers produced. $7 \%$ of computers produced in the factory turn out to be defective. It is known that

$P$ (computer turns out to be defective given that it is produced in plant $T_{1}$ )

$=10 P\left(\right.$ computer turns out to be defective given that it is produced in plant $\left.T_{2}\right)$,

where $P(E)$ denotes the probability of an event $E$. A computer produced in the factory is randomly selected and it does not turn out to be defective. Then the probability that it is produced in plant $T_{2}$ is

(A) $\frac{36}{73}$

(B) $\frac{47}{79}$

(C) $\frac{78}{93}$

(D) $\frac{75}{83}$",C,"To find the probability that a computer selected randomly and not defective is produced in plant $T_{2}$, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let $D$ be the event that a computer is defective, and $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ be the events that a computer is produced in plant $T_{1}$ and plant $T_{2}$ respectively.

We are given:
$P(D) = 0.07$
$P(D|T_{1}) = 0.1P(D|T_{2})$

We want to find $P(T_{2}|D')$, where $D'$ is the event that a computer is not defective.

By Bayes' Theorem:
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{P(D'|T_{2})P(T_{2})}{P(D')}$
$P(D') = 1 - P(D) = 0.93$

We know that $P(D|T_{1}) = 0.1P(D|T_{2})$, so $P(D|T_{1}) = 0.1(1 - P(D|T_{1}))$.
This gives us $0.1 = 0.1 - 0.1P(D|T_{1})$, which simplifies to $P(D|T_{1}) = 0$.

Therefore, $P(D'|T_{1}) = 1 - P(D|T_{1}) = 1$.

Now we can calculate $P(T_{2}|D')$:
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{P(D'|T_{2})P(T_{2})}{P(D')}$
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{(1)(0.8)}{0.93} = \frac{0.8}{0.93} = \frac{80}{93}$

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $\frac{78}{93}$.",True,6.32
"The least value of $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ for which $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$, for all $x>0$, is

(A) $\frac{1}{64}$

(B) $\frac{1}{32}$

(C) $\frac{1}{27}$

(D) $\frac{1}{25}$",C,"To find the least value of $\alpha$ for which $4\alpha x^{2} + \frac{1}{x} \geq 1$ for all $x > 0$, we need to analyze the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the inequality as $4\alpha x^{3} + 1 \geq x$.

Since this inequality must hold for all $x > 0$, we can consider the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ to find the least value of $\alpha$.

Taking the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ on both sides of the inequality, we get:
$\lim_{x \to 0} (4\alpha x^{3} + 1) \geq \lim_{x \to 0} x$
$1 \geq 0$

This shows that the inequality holds for all $x > 0$ when $\alpha = \frac{1}{27}$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $\frac{1}{27}$.",True,11.42
