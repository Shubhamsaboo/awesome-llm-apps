"Let $-\frac{\pi}{6}<\theta<-\frac{\pi}{12}$. Suppose $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$ and $\alpha_{2}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2}+2 x \tan \theta-1=0$.

(A) $2(\sec \theta-\tan \theta)$

(B) $2 \sec \theta$

(C) $-2 \tan \theta$

(D) 0",C,"To find the values of $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$, we need to solve the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$. This is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, where $a=1$, $b=-2\sec \theta$, and $c=1$. 

The roots of a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$. 

Substitute $a=1$, $b=-2\sec \theta$, and $c=1$ into the formula to find the roots $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$. Since $\alpha_{1}>\beta_{1}$, we can determine which root is $\alpha_{1}$ and which is $\beta_{1$.

Similarly, to find the values of $\alpha_{2}$ and $\beta_{2}$, we need to solve the equation $x^{2}+2 x \tan \theta-1=0$. This is also a quadratic equation in the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, where $a=1$, $b=2\tan \theta$, and $c=-1$.

Using the quadratic formula, find the roots $\alpha_{2}$ and $\beta_{2}$. Since $\alpha_{2}>\beta_{2}$, we can determine which root is $\alpha_{2}$ and which is $\beta_{2}$.

Finally, calculate $\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}$ using the values of $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$. The correct answer is $-2\tan \theta$, which is option (C).",True,5.61
"A debate club consists of 6 girls and 4 boys. A team of 4 members is to be selected from this club including the selection of a captain (from among these 4 members) for the team. If the team has to include at most one boy, then the number of ways of selecting the team is

(D) 95",A,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios for selecting the team with at most one boy.

1. Selecting a team with no boys:
In this case, we need to select 4 girls from the 6 available girls. This can be done in 6 choose 4 ways, which is equal to 15 ways.

2. Selecting a team with one boy:
We can select 1 boy from the 4 available boys and 3 girls from the 6 available girls. This can be done in 4 choose 1 * 6 choose 3 ways, which is equal to 80 ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways of selecting the team with at most one boy is the sum of the ways from the two scenarios:

"Let $S=\left\{x \in(-\pi, \pi): x \neq 0, \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\right\}$. The sum of all distinct solutions of the equation $\sqrt{3} \sec x+\operatorname{cosec} x+2(\tan x-\cot x)=0$ in the set $S$ is equal to

(A) $-\frac{7 \pi}{9}$

(B) $-\frac{2 \pi}{9}$

(C) 0

(D) $\frac{5 \pi}{9}$",C,"To solve the given equation $\sqrt{3} \sec x+\csc x+2(\tan x-\cot x)=0$, we first need to simplify it.

Recall that $\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}$ and $\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$.

Substitute these into the equation:
$\sqrt{3} \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} - \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}) = 0$

Simplify further:
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x}) = 0$

Using the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, we can simplify the equation to:
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{1 - 2\cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x}) = 0$

Now, let's combine the terms:
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{2}{\sin x \cos x} - \frac{4\cos x}{\sin x} = 0$

To simplify further, find a common denominator:
$\frac{\sqrt{3}\sin x + \cos x + 2 - 4\cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = 0$

Now, we have the equation:
$\sqrt{3}\sin x + \cos x + 2 - 4\cos^2 x = 0$

Rearrange the terms:
$4\cos^2 x - \sqrt{3}\sin x - \cos x - 2 = 0$

This is a quadratic equation in terms of $\cos x$. Let $t = \cos x$:
$4t^2 - \sqrt{3}\sqrt{1-t^2} - t - 2 = 0$

Solve this quadratic equation to find the values of $\cos x$. Then, find the corresponding values of $x$ in the set $S$.

"A computer producing factory has only two plants $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$. Plant $T_{1}$ produces $20 \%$ and plant $T_{2}$ produces $80 \%$ of the total computers produced. $7 \%$ of computers produced in the factory turn out to be defective. It is known that

(A) $\frac{36}{73}$

(B) $\frac{47}{79}$

(C) $\frac{78}{93}$

(D) $\frac{75}{83}$",C,"To find the probability that a computer selected randomly and not defective is produced in plant $T_{2}$, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let $D$ be the event that a computer is defective, and let $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ be the events that a computer is produced in plant $T_{1}$ and plant $T_{2}$ respectively.

We are given:
$P(D) = 0.07$
$P(D|T_{1}) = 0.1P(D|T_{2})$

We want to find $P(T_{2}|D')$, where $D'$ is the event that a computer is not defective.

By Bayes' Theorem:
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{P(D'|T_{2})P(T_{2})}{P(D')}$
$P(D') = 1 - P(D) = 0.93$

We know that $P(D|T_{1}) = 0.1P(D|T_{2})$, so $P(D|T_{1}) = 0.1(1 - P(D|T_{1}))$.
This gives us $0.07 = 0.1(1 - 0.07)$
$0.07 = 0.1(0.93)$
$0.07 = 0.093$

Therefore, $P(D|T_{1}) = 0.093$ and $P(D|T_{2}) = 0.007$.

Now, we can calculate $P(T_{2}|D')$:
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{P(D'|T_{2})P(T_{2})}{P(D')}$
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{(1 - P(D|T_{2}))P(T_{2})}{1 - P(D)}$
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{(1 - 0.007)(0.8)}{0.93}$
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{0.7936}{0.93}$
$P(T_{2}|D') = \frac{78}{93}$

"The least value of $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ for which $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$, for all $x>0$, is

(A) $\frac{1}{64}$

(B) $\frac{1}{32}$

(C) $\frac{1}{27}$

(D) $\frac{1}{25}$",C,"To find the least value of $\alpha$ for which $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$ for all $x>0$, we need to determine the minimum value of $\alpha$ that satisfies this inequality for all positive values of $x$.

Given the inequality $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$, we can rewrite it as $4 \alpha x^{3} - x + 1 \geq 0$.

For this expression to be greater than or equal to zero for all positive values of $x$, the discriminant of the cubic polynomial $4 \alpha x^{3} - x + 1$ must be less than or equal to zero.

The discriminant of a cubic polynomial $ax^{3} + bx^{2} + cx + d$ is given by $\Delta = 18abcd - 4b^{3}d + b^{2}c^{2} - 4ac^{3} - 27a^{2}d^{2}$.

In this case, $a = 4 \alpha$, $b = 0$, $c = -1$, and $d = 1$. Substituting these values into the formula for the discriminant, we get $\Delta = -4(0)^{3}(1) + 0^{2}(-1)^{2} - 4(4 \alpha)(-1)^{3} - 27(4 \alpha)^{2}(1)^{2}$.

Simplifying this expression, we get $\Delta = 16 \alpha + 108 \alpha^{2}$.

For the discriminant to be less than or equal to zero, we need $16 \alpha + 108 \alpha^{2} \leq 0$.

This inequality simplifies to $108 \alpha^{2} + 16 \alpha \leq 0$.

Factoring out $\alpha$, we get $\alpha(108 \alpha + 16) \leq 0$.

This inequality holds true for $\alpha \leq 0$ and $\alpha \leq -\frac{4}{27}$.

Since $\alpha$ must be a real number, the least value of $\alpha$ for which the inequality holds for all positive values of $x$ is $\alpha = -\frac{4}{27}$.

(D) the perpendicular distance from $O$ to the straight line containing $R S$ is $\sqrt{\frac{15}{2}}$",BCD,"To solve this problem, let's first visualize the pyramid $OPQRS$ in the first octant.

Given:
- $OP = 3$
- $TS = 3$
- $OT = \frac{1}{2}OQ = \frac{1}{2}(3\sqrt{2}) = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$

Let's find the coordinates of points $Q$ and $S$:
- $Q$ lies on the $x$-axis, so its coordinates are $(3, 0, 0)$
- $T$ is the midpoint of $OQ$, so its coordinates are $(\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{2}, 0, 0)$
- $S$ is directly above $T$ with $TS = 3$, so its coordinates are $(\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{2}, 0, 3)$

Now, let's find the vectors $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\overrightarrow{OS}$:
- $\overrightarrow{OQ} = \langle 3, 0, 0 \rangle$
- $\overrightarrow{OS} = \langle \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{2}, 0, 3 \rangle$

Next, let's find the dot product of $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\overrightarrow{OS}$:
$\overrightarrow{OQ} \cdot \overrightarrow{OS} = 3 \cdot \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{2} + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 3 = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{2}$

Now, let's find the magnitudes of $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\overrightarrow{OS}$:
$|\overrightarrow{OQ}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = 3$
$|\overrightarrow{OS}| = \sqrt{(\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{2})^2 + 0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{2} + 9} = \sqrt{\frac{27}{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$

Now, let's find the angle between $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\overrightarrow{OS}$ using the dot product formula:
$\cos{\theta} = \frac{\overrightarrow{OQ} \cdot \overrightarrow{OS}}{|\overrightarrow{OQ}| \cdot |\overrightarrow{OS}|} = \frac{\frac{9\sqrt{2}}{2}}{3 \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2}$

Let's analyze each option:

(A) $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0+} f^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=1$

To check this, we substitute $x = \frac{1}{t}$ into $f^{\prime}(x)$:
$$f^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 2 - \frac{f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}{\frac{1}{x}} = 2 - x f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$

As $x \rightarrow 0^+$, the term $x f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ approaches 0, not 1. Therefore, option (A) is false.

(B) $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0+} x f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=2$

Similarly, substituting $x = \frac{1}{t}$ into $x f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ gives:
$$\lim _{x \rightarrow 0+} x f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} f(t)$$

This limit does not necessarily equal 2, so option (B) is also false.

(C) $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0+} x^{2} f^{\prime}(x)=0$

Substitute $x = \frac{1}{t}$ into $x^{2} f^{\prime}(x)$:
$$\lim _{x \rightarrow 0+} x^{2} f^{\prime}(x) = \lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t^2} f^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)$$

Since $f^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{t}\right) = 2 - t f(t)$, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, the term $t f(t)$ approaches 0, making the overall limit 0. Therefore, option (C) is true.

(D) $|f(x)| \leq 2$ for all $x \in(0,2)$

To check this, we need to analyze the function $f(x)$ further based on the given differential equation. This option is not directly related to the limit behavior, so we cannot determine its validity based on the information provided.

2. $\frac{s-x}{4} = \frac{s-y}{3} = \frac{s-z}{2}$.
3. The area of the incircle of triangle $XYZ$ is $\frac{8\pi}{3}$.

Let's break down the answer choices:

(A) The area of the triangle $XYZ$ is $6\sqrt{6}$:
To find the area of a triangle given the inradius (radius of the incircle), we can use the formula $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. Since the inradius is given as $\frac{8\pi}{3}$, and the semi-perimeter $s = \frac{x+y+z}{2}$, we can calculate the area of the triangle using the formula. Therefore, option (A) is correct.

(B) The radius of the circumcircle of triangle $XYZ$ is $\frac{35}{6}\sqrt{6}$:
The circumradius of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $R = \frac{abc}{4A}$, where $R$ is the circumradius, $a, b, c$ are the side lengths of the triangle, and $A$ is the area of the triangle. Since the side lengths are not given directly, we cannot determine the circumradius. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.

(C) $\sin\frac{X}{2} \sin\frac{Y}{2} \sin\frac{Z}{2} = \frac{4}{35}$:
The product of sines of half angles in a triangle is equal to $\frac{r}{4R}$, where $r$ is the inradius and $R$ is the circumradius. Since the inradius is given as $\frac{8\pi}{3}$ and the circumradius is not directly provided, we cannot calculate this expression. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.

(C) intersects $y=(x+2)^{2}$

(D) does NO'T intersect $y=(x+3)^{2}$",AD,"To solve this problem, we first need to rewrite the given differential equation in a more standard form. 

Given: $\left(x^{2}+x y+4 x+2 y+4\right) \frac{d y}{d x}-y^{2}=0$

Rearranging terms, we get: $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^{2}}{x^{2}+xy+4x+2y+4}$

Now, we are given that the solution curve passes through the point $(1,3)$. We can use this information to find the particular solution to the differential equation.

Substitute $x=1$ and $y=3$ into the differential equation:

$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{9}{1+3+4+6+4} = \frac{9}{18} = \frac{1}{2}$

Integrating both sides, we get: $\int dy = \int \frac{1}{2} dx$

Using the point $(1,3)$, we find that $C = 2$.

Therefore, the particular solution to the differential equation passing through $(1,3)$ is $y = \frac{1}{2}x + 2$, which is the equation of the line $y = x + 2$.

Now, we need to determine how this solution curve intersects the line $y=x+2$ and the curve $y=(x+2)^{2}$.

Substitute $y=x+2$ into the differential equation:

$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(x+2)^{2}}{x^{2}+x(x+2)+4x+2(x+2)+4} = \frac{(x+2)^{2}}{x^{2}+3x+4x+4+2x+4} = \frac{(x+2)^{2}}{x^{2}+9x+8}$

This equation simplifies to $1$, so the solution curve intersects $y=(x+2)^{2}$. Therefore, option (C) is correct.

Since $g(f(x)) = x$, we can rewrite $g(g(0)) = 0$ as $g(f(0)) = 0$.
Substitute $x = 0$ into $f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2$ to get $f(0) = 2$.

Based on this information, we can now evaluate the answer choices:

(A) $Q_{2}Q_{3}=12$: Since $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ lie on the $y$-axis and have equal radii of $2\sqrt{3}$, the distance between them would be $2\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

(B) $R_{2}R_{3}=4\sqrt{6}$: This answer choice is correct based on the given information about the radii of circles $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$.

(C) The area of the triangle $OR_{2}R_{3}$ is $6\sqrt{2}$: To calculate this area, we need to find the coordinates of points $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ and then use the formula for the area of a triangle. This calculation leads to the correct answer.

The integral $\int_{0}^{x} \frac{t^{2}}{1+t^{4}} dt$ can be simplified by using the substitution $u = t^2$, which gives $du = 2t dt$. This transforms the integral into $\int \frac{1}{1+u^2} du$, which is a standard integral that can be evaluated using the arctangent function.

After evaluating the integral and applying the limits of integration from 0 to $x$, we get $\arctan(x) - \arctan(0) = \arctan(x)$.

The limit provided is $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^{2} \sin (\beta x)}{\alpha x-\sin x}=1$. As $x$ approaches 0, the expression $\frac{x^{2} \sin (\beta x)}{\alpha x-\sin x}$ approaches 1.

Now, we can rewrite the given limit as $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^{2} \sin (\beta x)}{\alpha x-\sin x} = 1$.

Next, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $x$. This gives us $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x \sin (\beta x)}{\alpha - \frac{\sin x}{x}} = 1$.

As $x$ approaches 0, we know that $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} x \sin (\beta x) = \alpha$.

Now, we can evaluate the limit of $x \sin (\beta x)$ as $x$ approaches 0. Since the limit is equal to $\alpha$, we have $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} x \sin (\beta x) = \alpha$.

This implies that $\beta = 1$, as the limit of $x \sin (\beta x)$ as $x$ approaches 0 is equal to $\alpha.

Since $\log_e b_1, \log_e b_2, \ldots, \log_e b_{101}$ are in A.P. with common difference $\log_e 2$, we can write:
$\log_e b_i = \log_e b_1 + (i-1)\log_e 2$

Similarly, since $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{101}$ are in A.P. with $a_1 = b_1$ and $a_{51} = b_{51}$, we can write:
$a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d$

$t = b_1(1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{50})$
$t = b_1 \cdot \frac{2^{51}-1}{2-1}$
$t = b_1 \cdot (2^{51}-1)$

$s = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{51}$
$s = a_1 + a_1 + d + a_1 + 2d + \cdots + a_1 + 50d$
$s = 51a_1 + \frac{51 \cdot 50}{2}d$
$s = 51b_1 + 25d$

$s = 51b_1 + 25\log_e 2$
$t = b_1 \cdot (2^{51}-1)$

Since $b_1 > 1$, $2^{51} > 51$ and $2^{51}-1 > 50$, we can see that $t > s$.

The normal vector to the plane $x-y+z=3$ is $(1,-1,1)$ because the coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the equation of the plane represent the components of the normal vector.

The projection of a point $A(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ onto a plane with normal vector $n=(a,b,c)$ passing through a point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is given by:
$$P = A - \frac{(A-P) \cdot n}{||n||^2}n$$

$$P = (3,1,7) - \frac{(3,1,7)-(0,0,3) \cdot (1,-1,1)}{||(1,-1,1)||^2}(1,-1,1)$$
$$P = (3,1,7) - \frac{(3,1,4) \cdot (1,-1,1)}{3}(1,-1,1)$$
$$P = (3,1,7) - \frac{3-1+4}{3}(1,-1,1)$$
$$P = (3,1,7) - \frac{6}{3}(1,-1,1)$$
$$P = (3,1,7) - 2(1,-1,1)$$
$$P = (3,1,7) - (2,-2,2)$$
$$P = (1,3,5)$$

So, the image of the point $(3,1,7)$ with respect to the plane $x-y+z=3$ is $(1,3,5)$.

Next, we need to find the equation of the plane passing through $P=(1,3,5)$ and containing the straight line $\frac{x}{1}=\frac{y}{2}=\frac{z}{1}$.

The direction vector of the line is $(1,2,1)$.

Since the plane passes through $P=(1,3,5)$, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane:
$$n \cdot (r-P) = 0$$
where $n$ is the normal vector to the plane and $r$ is a general point on the plane.

Substitute $P=(1,3,5)$ and $n=(1,2,1)$ into the equation:
$$(1,2,1) \cdot (r-(1,3,5)) = 0$$
$$(1,2,1) \cdot (r-1,r-3,r-5) = 0$$
$$r-1+2(r-3)+r-5 = 0$$
$$r-1+2r-6+r-5 = 0$$
$$4r-12 = 0$$
$$4r = 12$$
$$r = 3$$

Therefore, the equation of the plane passing through $P$ and containing the straight line $\frac{x}{1}=\frac{y}{2}=\frac{z}{1}$ is $4x-12=0$, which simplifies to $x-3=0$ or $x=3$.

Since $x^{2}-3$ is a continuous function, it will change integer values at points where $x^{2}-3$ crosses an integer. This happens when $x=\sqrt{3}$, $x=-\sqrt{3}$, $x=2$, and $x=-\frac{1}{2}$. At these points, $f(x)$ will have a jump discontinuity.
Therefore, $f$ is discontinuous exactly at four points in $\left[-\frac{1}{2}, 2\right]$, which matches option (B).

2. Function $g(x)=|x| f(x)+|4 x-7| f(x)$:
The function $g(x)$ is a combination of absolute value functions multiplied by $f(x)$. Absolute value functions introduce points of non-differentiability where the function changes direction abruptly.
The absolute value function $|x|$ changes direction at $x=0$, and $|4x-7|$ changes direction at $x=\frac{7}{4}$. Since $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=\sqrt{3}$, $x=-\sqrt{3}$, $x=2$, and $x=-\frac{1}{2}$, the product of these functions will have points of non-differentiability at these points as well.
Therefore, $g$ is NOT differentiable exactly at four points in $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, 2\right)$, which matches option (C).

(C) the $x$-axis for $a \neq 0, b=0$

(D) the $y$-axis for $a=0, b \neq 0$",ACD,"To determine where the point $(x, y)$ lies when $z \in S$, we need to substitute $z = \frac{1}{a + ibt}$ into the expression $z = x + iy$.

Substitute $z = \frac{1}{a + ibt}$ into $z = x + iy$:
$\frac{1}{a + ibt} = x + iy$

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
$\frac{1}{a + ibt} = \frac{1}{a + ibt} \cdot \frac{a - ibt}{a - ibt} = \frac{a - ibt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$

Therefore, $x = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$ and $y = -\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$.

Now, let's analyze the possible cases:

For $a > 0, b \neq 0$:
- $x = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2t^2} > 0$ and $y = -\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$ can take any real value.
- This corresponds to a point on the circle with radius $\frac{1}{2a}$ and center $\left(\frac{1}{2a}, 0\right)$.

For $a < 0, b \neq 0$:
- $x = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2t^2} < 0$ and $y = -\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$ can take any real value.
- This corresponds to a point on the circle with radius $-\frac{1}{2a}$ and center $\left(-\frac{1}{2a}, 0\right)$.

For $a \neq 0, b = 0$:
- $x = \frac{a}{a^2} = \frac{1}{a}$ and $y = 0$.
- This corresponds to a point on the $x$-axis.

For $a = 0, b \neq 0$:
- $x = 0$ and $y = -\frac{bt}{b^2t^2} = -\frac{1}{bt}$.
- This corresponds to a point on the $y$-axis.

(B) $S Q: Q P=(\sqrt{5}+1): 2$

(C) the $x$-intercept of the normal to the parabola at $P$ is 6

(D) the slope of the tangent to the circle at $Q$ is $\frac{1}{2}$",ACD,"To find the point $P$ on the parabola $y^2 = 4x$ that is at the shortest distance from the center $S$ of the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 16y + 64 = 0, we need to first find the coordinates of $P$ and $S$.

The center of the circle can be found by completing the square for the equation of the circle:
$x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 16y + 64 = 0$
$(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 - 16y) = -64$
$(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 16y + 64) = -64 + 4 + 64$
$(x - 2)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 4$
So, the center of the circle is at $S(2, 8)$.

Now, we need to find the point $P$ on the parabola that is at the shortest distance from $S(2, 8)$. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:
$D = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

Let $P(x, y)$ be the point on the parabola. The distance between $P$ and $S$ is the shortest when the line joining $P$ and $S$ is perpendicular to the parabola. The slope of the tangent to the parabola at $P$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line joining $P$ and $S$.

The equation of the tangent to the parabola at $P(x, y)$ is given by:
$y = mx + a/m$
where $m$ is the slope of the tangent and $a$ is a constant.

The slope of the tangent to the parabola at $P(x, y)$ is given by the derivative of the parabola equation:
$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(4x) = 4$
So, the slope of the tangent at $P(x, y)$ is $4$.

Since the line joining $P$ and $S$ is perpendicular to the tangent at $P$, the slope of the line joining $P$ and $S$ is $-\frac{1}{4}$.

The equation of the line passing through $P(x, y)$ and $S(2, 8)$ is:
$y - 8 = -\frac{1}{4}(x - 2)$
$4y - 32 = -x + 2$
$x + 4y = 34$

Substitute $y^2 = 4x$ into the equation of the line:
$x + 4(2\sqrt{x}) = 34$
$x + 8\sqrt{x} - 34 = 0$
$x + 8\sqrt{x} - 34 = 0$

Solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(-34)}}{2(1)}$
$x = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 136}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{200}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-8 \pm 10\sqrt{2}}{2}$
$x = -4 \pm 5\sqrt{2}$

Since $x = -4 + 5\sqrt{2}$ is the only positive solution, $P(-4 + 5\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})$.

Now, find the coordinates of $Q$ by dividing the line segment $SP$ internally. Let $Q$ divide $SP$ in the ratio $(\sqrt{5} + 1) : 2$.

Let the coordinates of $Q$ be $(x_Q, y_Q)$. Then:
$\frac{x_Q - 2}{-4 + 5\sqrt{2} - 2} = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$
$\frac{y_Q - 8}{2\sqrt{2} - 8} = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$

Solve for $x_Q$ and $y_Q$ to find the coordinates of $Q$.

(D) If $\lambda+\mu \neq 0$, then the system has no solution for $\alpha=-3$",BCD,"To determine which statement(s) are correct, let's analyze the system of linear equations given:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& a x + 2y = \lambda \quad \text{(1)} \\
& 3x - 2y = \mu \quad \text{(2)}
\end{aligned}
\]

First, let's find the values of $x$ and $y$ by solving the system of equations.

From equation (1), we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:
\[ y = \frac{\lambda - ax}{2} \]

Now, substitute this expression for $y$ into equation (2):
\[ 3x - 2\left(\frac{\lambda - ax}{2}\right) = \mu \]
\[ 3x - \lambda + ax = \mu \]
\[ (3 + a)x = \lambda + \mu \]
\[ x = \frac{\lambda + \mu}{3 + a} \]

Now, substitute this value of $x$ back into equation (1) to find $y$:
\[ y = \frac{\lambda - a\left(\frac{\lambda + \mu}{3 + a}\right)}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{\lambda(3 + a) - a(\lambda + \mu)}{2(3 + a)} \]
\[ y = \frac{3\lambda + a\lambda - a\lambda - a\mu}{2(3 + a)} \]
\[ y = \frac{3\lambda - a\mu}{2(3 + a)} \]

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
\[ x = \frac{\lambda + \mu}{3 + a} \]
\[ y = \frac{3\lambda - a\mu}{2(3 + a)} \]

Now, let's analyze each statement:

(A) If $a = -3$, then the system has infinitely many solutions for all values of $\lambda$ and $\mu$.
Substitute $a = -3$ into the solution:
\[ x = \frac{\lambda + \mu}{0} \]
This implies that $x$ can take any value, so the system has infinitely many solutions for all values of $\lambda$ and $\mu. Therefore, statement (A) is correct.

(B) If $a \neq -3$, then the system has a unique solution for all values of $\lambda$ and $\mu.
Since the solution for $x$ and $y$ depends on $a$, if $a \neq -3$, the system will have a unique solution for all values of $\lambda$ and $\mu. Therefore, statement (B) is correct.

(C) If $\lambda + \mu = 0$, then the system has infinitely many solutions for $a = -3$.
Substitute $\lambda + \mu = 0$ into the solution:
\[ x = \frac{0}{3 + (-3)} = 0 \]
\[ y = \frac{3(0) - (-3)\mu}{2(3 + (-3))} = \frac{3\mu}{6} = \frac{\mu}{2} \]
This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = \frac{\mu}{2}$, which means the system has infinitely many solutions for $a = -3$. Therefore, statement (C) is correct.

(D) If $\lambda + \mu \neq 0$, then the system has no solution for $a = -3$.
If $\lambda + \mu \neq 0$, the system will have a unique solution for $a = -3$, as shown in statement (C). Therefore, statement (D) is incorrect.

(D) If $\hat{u}$ lies in the $x z$-plane then $2\left|u_{1}\right|=\left|u_{3}\right|$",BC,"To find the vector $\vec{v}$ that satisfies the given conditions, we first need to calculate the cross product $\hat{u} \times \vec{v}$.

Given that $|\hat{u} \times \vec{v}| = 1$, we have:
$$|\hat{u} \times \vec{v}| = |\hat{u}||\vec{v}|\sin(\theta) = 1$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\hat{u}$ and $\vec{v}$.

Since $\hat{u}$ is a unit vector, $|\hat{u}| = 1$, so $|\vec{v}|\sin(\theta) = 1$.

Next, we are given that $\hat{w} \cdot (\hat{u} \times \vec{v}) = 1$. We can expand this dot product as follows:
$$\hat{w} \cdot (\hat{u} \times \vec{v}) = \hat{w} \cdot (\hat{u} \times \vec{v}) = |\hat{w}||\hat{u}||\vec{v}|\sin(\phi) = 1$$
where $\phi$ is the angle between $\hat{w}$ and $\hat{u} \times \vec{v}$.

Substitute the expressions for $|\hat{u} \times \vec{v}|$ and $|\vec{v}|\sin(\theta)$ into the equation above:
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1$$
Solving this equation, we find that $\phi = 0$.

Since $\phi = 0$, it means that $\hat{w}$ and $\hat{u} \times \vec{v}$ are parallel. Therefore, $\hat{u} \times \vec{v}$ is a scalar multiple of $\hat{w}$.

Now, we can express $\hat{u} \times \vec{v}$ as $k\hat{w}$, where $k$ is a scalar.

Taking the cross product of $\hat{u}$ and $\hat{w}$, we get:
$$\hat{u} \times \hat{w} = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ u_{1} & u_{2} & u_{3} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} & \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \end{vmatrix}$$
$$= \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(u_{2}-2u_{3})\hat{i} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(u_{1}-2u_{3})\hat{j} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(u_{1}-u_{2})\hat{k}$$

Since $\hat{u} \times \vec{v} = k\hat{w}$, we can equate the components of both sides to find $k$.

Comparing the components, we get:
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(u_{2}-2u_{3}) = k$$
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(u_{1}-2u_{3}) = k$$
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(u_{1}-u_{2}) = k$$

The equation of the tangent line $2x-y+1=0$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as $y=2x+1$. This means that the slope of the tangent line is 2.

The given hyperbola equation $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{y^{2}}{16}=1$ can be rearranged to $y=\pm\frac{4}{a}\sqrt{x^{2}-a^{2}}$. By comparing this equation with the slope-intercept form of the tangent line, we can see that the slope of the hyperbola at the point of tangency is $\pm\frac{4}{a}$.

For the tangent line and the hyperbola to be tangent at a point, their slopes at that point must be equal. Therefore, we have $\pm\frac{4}{a}=2$, which simplifies to $a=\pm2$. This means that $a$ can be either 2 or -2 for the given conditions to hold.

3. $P(Y \mid X) = \frac{2}{5}$: This is the conditional probability of event $Y$ occurring given that event $X$ has already occurred.

Now, let's solve for each part of the question:

[A] $P(Y) = \frac{P(X \cap Y)}{P(Y \mid X)}$: Using the formula for conditional probability, we can rearrange it to find $P(Y)$. Substituting the given values, we get $P(Y) = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{5}}{\frac{2}{5}} = \frac{2}{15} = \frac{4}{15}$. Therefore, answer [A] is correct.

[B] $P(X' \mid Y) = 1 - P(X \mid Y)$: This is the probability of event $X$ not occurring given that event $Y$ has occurred. Substituting the given value, we get $P(X' \mid Y) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, answer [B] is correct.

[C] $P(X \cap Y)$: This is the probability of both events $X$ and $Y$ occurring. We can find this using the formula $P(X \cap Y) = P(X) \times P(Y \mid X) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{15} = \frac{1}{5}$. Therefore, answer [C] is correct.

[D] $P(X \cup Y) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X \cap Y)$: This is the probability of either event $X$ or event $Y$ occurring. Substituting the given values, we get $P(X \cup Y) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{4}{15} - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{5}{15} + \frac{4}{15} - \frac{3}{15} = \frac{6}{15} = \frac{2}{5}$.

"For how many values of $p$, the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x+4 y-p=0$ and the coordinate axes have exactly three common points?",2,"To find the number of values of $p$ for which the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2x+4y-p=0$ and the coordinate axes have exactly three common points, we need to consider the possible cases.

When the circle intersects the x-axis, the y-coordinate is 0. Substituting $y=0$ into the equation of the circle gives $x^{2}+2x-p=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$. For the circle to intersect the x-axis at exactly two points, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be greater than 0. Therefore, $4-4(-p)>0$ which simplifies to $p<1$.

Similarly, when the circle intersects the y-axis, the x-coordinate is 0. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation of the circle gives $y^{2}+4y-p=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $y$. For the circle to intersect the y-axis at exactly two points, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be greater than 0. Therefore, $16-4(-p)>0$ which simplifies to $p<4$.

To find the values of $p$ for which the circle intersects both the x-axis and the y-axis, we need to find the intersection of the inequalities $p<1$ and $p<4$. This intersection gives $p<1$.

The given function inside the integral is $f'(t) \csc t - \cot t \csc t f(t)$. We can rewrite this expression using trigonometric identities. Recall that $\csc t = \frac{1}{\sin t}$ and $\cot t = \frac{1}{\tan t} = \frac{\cos t}{\sin t}$.

Substitute these identities into the function inside the integral:
$f'(t) \csc t - \cot t \csc t f(t) = f'(t) \cdot \frac{1}{\sin t} - \frac{\cos t}{\sin t} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin t} f(t)$
$= \frac{f'(t)}{\sin t} - \frac{\cos t}{\sin^2 t} f(t)$

$g(x) = \int_{x}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(\frac{f'(t)}{\sin t} - \frac{\cos t}{\sin^2 t} f(t)\right) dt$

Since $f'(t)$ is the derivative of $f(t)$, we can rewrite the first term using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
$g(x) = \left[-\frac{f(t)}{\sin t}\right]_{x}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} - \int_{x}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\cos t}{\sin^2 t} f(t) dt$

Now, we evaluate the limits of the first term:

$= -\frac{3}{1} + \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x)}{\sin x} = -3 + 1 = -2$

This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 10 different letters taken all at a time from the given set of letters $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J$. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time, which is $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$. In this case, $n=10$ and $r=10$, so $x = \frac{10!}{(10-10)!} = 10! = 3,628,800$.

Next, the value of $y$ represents the number of words of length 10 where exactly one letter is repeated twice and no other letter is repeated. This can be calculated by first choosing the letter to be repeated in $\binom{10}{1}$ ways, then choosing the positions for the repeated letter in $\binom{10}{2}$ ways, and finally arranging the remaining 8 distinct letters in $8!$ ways.

Area = 1/2 * base * height

Since the sides of the triangle are in arithmetic progression, let's denote the three sides as a - d, a, and a + d, where 'a' is the smallest side and 'd' is the common difference.

Given that the area of the triangle is 24, we can set up the equation:

1/2 * (a - d) * a = 24

Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:

1/2 * (a^2 - ad) = 24
a^2 - ad = 48
a(a - d) = 48

Since the sides are in arithmetic progression, we know that the middle side is the average of the other two sides. Therefore, a = (a - d) + (a + d) / 2
a = 2a / 2
a = a

Since the plane we are looking for is perpendicular to both of these planes, the normal vector to our plane will be perpendicular to both of these normal vectors. This means that the cross product of the normal vectors of the given planes will give us the normal vector of the plane we are looking for.

Calculating the cross product of $(2,1,-2)$ and $(3,-6,-2)$, we get the normal vector of the plane we are looking for as $(14,2,15)$.

Now, we have the normal vector of the plane passing through the point $(1,1,1)$ as $(14,2,15)$. Using the point-normal form of the equation of a plane, the equation of the plane passing through the point $(1,1,1)$ with normal vector $(14,2,15)$ is $14x+2y+15z = D$, where $D$ is a constant.
