    "\n",
    "**1. Document Loaders**  \n",
    "Load documents from various sources (e.g., HTML, PDFs, code). LangChain supports over 100 loaders, including integrations with tools like AirByte and Unstructured, for data from S3 buckets, websites, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Text Splitting**  \n",
    "Splits large documents into smaller, manageable chunks optimized for specific formats (e.g., code, markdown). This ensures efficient retrieval of relevant document parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Text Embedding Models**  \n",
    "Transforms text into vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based searches. LangChain supports 25+ embedding providers, offering flexibility in model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Vector Stores**  \n",
    "Efficiently store and search embeddings. LangChain integrates with 50+ vector databases, from local open-source solutions to cloud-hosted options, with a standard interface for easy switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Retrievers**  \n",
    "Retrieve relevant data from vector stores. LangChain offers various retrieval methods:  \n",
    "- **Parent Document Retriever**: Fetches smaller chunks but returns larger context.  \n",
    "- **Self Query Retriever**: Parses user queries to apply semantic and metadata filters.  \n",
    "- **Ensemble Retriever**: Combines multiple sources or algorithms for retrieval.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Indexing**  \n",
    "Optimizes syncing data into vector stores by avoiding duplication, skipping unchanged content, and saving time and cost during embedding computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain streamlines the retrieval pipeline, ensuring efficient and cost-effective data preparation and querying.\n",
