    "## **Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining their generative power with external information retrieval. Introduced by Meta AI in 2020, RAG allows LLMs to access up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits**\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Accuracy & Domain Expertise**: Integrates knowledge bases for precise and context-specific responses (e.g., technical queries).\n",
    "2. **Reduced Hallucination**: Ensures factual correctness by retrieving reliable external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Components**\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: Fetches relevant data from a knowledge base (e.g., documents, FAQs) for a given query.\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: Adds retrieved data to the LLM's context using techniques like summarization.\n",
    "3. **Generation**: Produces responses using both the LLM's language understanding and augmented information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications**\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Contextual chatbot support using product guides and FAQs.\n",
    "- **Document Summarization**: Extracts and condenses key points from large texts.\n",
    "- **Creative Text Generation**: Enhances storytelling with contextual historical or fictional data.\n",
    "- **Code Generation**: Suggests relevant code snippets and documentation for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How RAG Works**\n",
    "1. **Indexing Knowledge Base**:\n",
    "   - Clean and parse data from sources like PDFs or HTML.\n",
    "   - Split text into chunks and convert them into vector embeddings using models like BERT or GPT.\n",
    "   - Store embeddings in vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - Convert user queries into embeddings.\n",
    "   - Find the top K matching chunks from the vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generation**:\n",
    "   - Combine retrieved data with the query to create a prompt.\n",
    "   - The LLM generates a response based on this enriched prompt.\n",
