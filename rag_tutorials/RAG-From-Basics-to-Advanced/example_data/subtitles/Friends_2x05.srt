1
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,470
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,473
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,841
Spanish midgets wrestling....

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,611
Julie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,521
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

6
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,694
I'm trying this screening thing.

7
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:32,627
If I always answer the phone,
people will think I have no life.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,059
My God!
Rodrigo never gets pinned!

9
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,827
At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,903
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

11
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,368
This is Jade.

12
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,577
I don 't know if you 're still
at this number, but I was thinking...

13
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:49,146
...about how great it was.
I know it's been three years...

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,716
...but I was hoping
we could hook up again.

15
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,911
I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

16
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,350
-...so you know what I did?
-What?

17
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,559
I got a little drunk...

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,727
...and naked.

19
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,257
Bob here!

20
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,428
The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant

21
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:55,278
So what have you been up to?

22
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:57,175
Oh, you know, the usual.

23
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,747
Teaching aerobics...

24
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,745
...partying way too much.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,847
And in case you wondered...

26
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:08,024
... those are my legs on
the new James Bond poster.

27
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:13,462
Can you hold on?
I have another call.

28
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,360
-I love her!
-I know.

29
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,703
-I'm back.
-So are we gonna get together?

30
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:20,870
Absolutely.

31
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:23,198
How about tomorrow afternoon?

32
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:26,104
Do you know Central Perk?
Say, five-ish?

33
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,438
Great. I'll see you then.

34
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:35,079
Having a phone has finally paid off.

35
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:39,686
You do a good Bob impression...

36
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,586
... but when she
sees you tomorrow...

37
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:44,159
...she's gonna realize
you're not Bob.

38
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,202
...she'll seek comfort in the arms of
the stranger at the next table.

40
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:06,135
Oh, my God.
You are pure evil.

41
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,033
Okay, pure evil...

42
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,469
... horny and alone.

43
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,949
I've done this.

44
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,821
Yeah, everybody's here.

45
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:28,590
Hey, everybody!
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

46
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,254
Hi, Julie.

47
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,065
While Ross is on the phone...

48
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:38,170
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

49
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,737
Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

50
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:44,440
...you know...

51
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,271
...from like 20?

52
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:50,249
Hey, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

53
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,112
Do we need a cake?

54
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:55,287
I know it's a little steep.

55
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,049
But it's Ross.

56
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:02,689
It's Ross.

57
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,123
See you later.
I gotta go...

58
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:08,026
...do a thing!

59
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,632
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later.

60
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:14,363
You're not going
through with this, are you?

61
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:17,040
You know, I think I might just.

62
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:22,143
What are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

63
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:26,443
Well, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

64
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:30,323
I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

65
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,888
Can you believe
how much this costs?

66
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,396
Do you guys ever
get the feeling that...

67
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,063
... Chandler and those guys...

68
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,397
...don't get that
we don't make that much money?

69
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,768
They always say
let's go here, let's go there.

70
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:48,840
Like we can afford to go
here and there.

71
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:53,439
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice.

72
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:58,617
And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday thing...

73
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,184
...and it's "for Ross."

74
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,911
For Ross.

75
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,752
Oh, my God!

76
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,318
I'm at work...

77
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:12,459
...just an ordinary day,
chop, chop, saute, saute.

78
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:16,461
Suddenly, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

79
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,662
They fired the lunch chef,
and guess who got the job?

80
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:22,638
If it's not you,
this is a horrible story.

81
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:26,137
Fortunately, it is me.

82
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:28,815
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you!

83
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:30,641
That's so cool!

84
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:34,052
Anyway, I think we
should go out and celebrate.

85
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:36,188
You know, someplace nice.

86
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,319
Someplace nice.

87
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,291
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

88
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,731
You can't do this.

89
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:58,975
I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

90
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:00,213
It doesn't matter.

91
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:05,351
She wanted to call Bob. Bob could be
who she was meant to be with.

92
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:08,522
You may be destroying
their chance for happiness.

93
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:10,189
We don't know Bob.

94
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:14,592
We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

95
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,931
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

96
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,158
All right.

97
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,600
Go.

98
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:36,441
Listen, I have to....

99
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:38,678
I have to confess something.

100
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,250
Yes?

101
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:45,224
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

102
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:48,219
-How did you
-I don't know.

103
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:54,629
I just had this weird sense.
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

104
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,795
Tissue?

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,904
Thanks.

106
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,206
No, you keep the pack.

107
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,537
I'm all cried out today.

108
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:25,864
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

109
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:28,000
Also in charge of purchasing.

110
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,136
Head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing

111
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:34,636
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

112
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:39,278
Lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk
when Roland's not there...

113
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,608
-... here's to my
-Wait! And I got a beeper!

114
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,985
That's fine, I'll just wait.

115
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:49,256
Sorry.

116
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:52,189
Monica!

117
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:56,627
Are we ready to order?

118
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,457
We haven't even looked yet.

119
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,326
When you do, let me know.

120
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,264
I'll be over there
on the edge of my seat.

121
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,366
Look at these prices!

122
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:13,204
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

123
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,215
I know! What are these,
famous chickens?

124
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:21,179
Sorry I'm late.
Congratulations, Mon.

125
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:25,357
I'm not sorry I'm late.
How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?

126
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:29,120
Pretty incredible, according to
the message on my machine.

127
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:34,061
Why is this woman leaving a message
for you on my machine?

128
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,201
I told her that
my number was yours...

129
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:38,394
... because I couldn't
tell her it was mine...

130
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:41,573
... because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

131
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:46,368
Tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

132
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,174
Do I dare ask?

133
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:52,819
I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then the grilled prawns.

134
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,351
Great, same for me.

135
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,354
And for the gentleman?

136
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,217
I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

137
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:01,553
But if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

138
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,696
...is it cheaper?

139
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,195
You'd think, wouldn't you?

140
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:11,670
I will have the side salad.

141
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,533
And what would that
be on the side of?

142
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:16,439
I don't know.

143
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,702
Just put it right here
next to my water.

144
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,542
And for you?

145
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:28,749
I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and...

146
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:33,290
...take care.

147
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,357
I will have the Cajun catfish.

148
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:39,395
Anything else?

149
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,127
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

150
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:47,066
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

151
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,641
Plus tip, divided by six....

152
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:04,842
Everyone owes 28 bucks.

153
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:07,920
Everyone?

154
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,919
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

155
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:12,122
Thank you.

156
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,954
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

157
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,125
So five of us is...

158
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,895
...33. 50 a piece.

159
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:23,536
No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

160
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,636
Prom night flashback.

161
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:31,641
Sorry, Monica.
I'm happy you got promoted...

162
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:35,009
... but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

163
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,307
No!

164
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,176
Rachel just had that little salad...

165
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,789
...and Joey with his teeny pizza!

166
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,850
Okay, Pheebs.

167
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,156
How about we'll each
pay for what we had?

168
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,625
It's no big deal.

169
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:51,796
Not for you.

170
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,827
All right, what's going on?

171
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,966
I don't wanna get
into this right now.

172
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,234
It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

173
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,369
You can tell us.

174
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,482
Yeah, hello? It's us.
We'll be fine.

175
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,181
We three...

176
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:20,156
...feel like that...

177
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:24,320
...sometimes you guys don't get that....

178
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:34,106
We don't have
as much money as you.

179
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,347
I hear you.

180
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,073
We can talk about that.

181
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,380
Well, then...

182
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,281
...Iet's.

183
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,359
I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

184
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,724
-Because you have it.
-Good point!

185
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,799
So how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

186
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,769
Because it's always something.
Like with Monica's new job...

187
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,638
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

188
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:17,109
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative....

189
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:19,218
There's gonna be a hoopla?

190
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:26,250
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing

191
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,962
If it makes anybody feel better,
forget the thing...

192
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:32,223
...and we'll just do the gift.

193
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,992
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

194
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,800
No, we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

195
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,472
Hootie and the

196
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:43,006
I can catch them on the radio.

197
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:47,243
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

198
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:49,814
No, look. It's my birthday...

199
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:53,181
...and the important thing
is that we're all together.

200
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:54,353
-All of us.
-Together.

201
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,351
Not at the concert.

202
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,327
Thank you.

203
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:11,101
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

204
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,208
Gee, Monica.
What's in the bag?

205
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,971
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

206
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:23,116
Oh, it's like a skit.

207
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:27,516
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

208
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:30,121
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

209
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:36,061
We switched suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

210
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:40,529
But wait, there's more.
Chandler, what is in that envelope?

211
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,564
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

212
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,674
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish!

213
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,303
The Blowfish!

214
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,878
It's on us. So don't worry.
This is...

215
00:13:59,086 --> 00:13:59,916
...our treat.

216
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:02,689
Thank you.

217
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,522
Could you be less enthused?

218
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,162
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

219
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,160
But it just feels like....

220
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,665
Like?

221
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:15,265
Charity.

222
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:16,595
Charity?

223
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,203
We're just trying
to do a nice thing here.

224
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:23,502
But you have to understand, your
"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.

225
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:26,679
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

226
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,446
I don't understand.
We can't win with you guys.

227
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:35,779
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

228
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:37,921
Maybe that's just how you feel.

229
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:43,456
Now you're telling us how we feel.

230
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:45,732
We never should have talked about this.

231
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,093
I'm gonna pass on the concert.

232
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:51,203
I'm just not in a very
"Hootie" place right now.

233
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,038
-Me neither.
-Me too.

234
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,468
Guys, we bought the tickets.

235
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:02,237
Then you'll have extra seats
for all your tiaras and stuff.

236
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:06,815
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

237
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:11,987
So I guess now we can't go.

238
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:16,560
Do what you want. Do we always
have to do everything together?

239
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:19,589
You know what? You're right.

240
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,665
Fine.

241
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,069
All right.

242
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:28,737
We're gonna go.

243
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:36,749
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

244
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:49,956
Are you ready?

245
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:53,531
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

246
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,694
What? You had sex today?

247
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,273
It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it!

248
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:06,940
I was awesome. She was biting her lip
to stop from screaming.

249
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:11,883
I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

250
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:18,715
Still doing the screening?

251
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,854
I had sex today.

252
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:24,229
I never have to
answer that phone again.

253
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,559
At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

254
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,166
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

255
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:33,237
I wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn 't show up yesterday.

256
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:37,341
And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

257
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,245
Bob here.

258
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,042
So you met someone, huh?

259
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,718
Yes, I did.

260
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:49,478
In fact, I had sex
with him two hours ago.

261
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,855
So how was he?

262
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:08,605
Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

263
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,871
I bit my lip to keep from
screaming your name.

264
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:20,078
Well, that makes me feel so good.

265
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,583
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

266
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,793
Maybe he had some kind of new style
that you're not familiar with.

267
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:32,030
You have to get used to it.

268
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:34,598
There wasn 't much time
to get used to it...

269
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:36,770
...if you know what I mean.

270
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:49,749
You know what? I'm not gonna
be able to enjoy this.

271
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,249
I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

272
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:55,444
So let's go.

273
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:04,395
Well, maybe we should stay
for one song.

274
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:07,465
It would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

275
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:10,330
The guys are probably
having a great time.

276
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:15,965
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

277
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:18,942
One.

278
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:31,185
-Amazing!
-Excellent!

279
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,120
I can't believe the guys missed it!

280
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,261
What guys?
Oh, yeah.

281
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:39,622
Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica Geller?

282
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,433
-Do I know you?
-You were my baby-sitter!

283
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:45,601
Oh, my God!
Little Stevie Fisher?

284
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:47,296
How have you been?

285
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,202
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

286
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,710
You can't be a lawyer.
You're 8.

287
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,046
It was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

288
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:56,442
Wait, backstage?

289
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,208
My firm represents the band.

290
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:04,056
You guys wanna meet the group?

291
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:05,654
Come on.

292
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:09,192
Are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my Dad?

293
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:15,565
Hey, you guys!

294
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:16,701
Happy birthday!

295
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,565
Oh, thank you.

296
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,801
How was your night last night?

297
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:27,536
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

298
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:29,407
Ours pretty much sucked too.

299
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:32,082
But I ran into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

300
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:34,411
Oh, yeah!
I used to baby-sit him.

301
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,212
Hey, how's his dad?

302
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,653
Good.

303
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:43,258
Aside from that, the evening
was pretty much a bust.

304
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:46,398
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

305
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,366
Yeah, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

306
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:55,668
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like

307
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,167
Is that a hickey?

308
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,108
Oh, no, I just....

309
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:03,077
I fell down.

310
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:07,116
On someone's lips?

311
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,082
Where'd you get the hickey?

312
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,654
You know, a party or

313
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:12,655
What party?

314
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,420
It wasn't a party
so much as a...

315
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,459
...a gathering of people.

316
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:21,127
With food and music and...

317
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:23,028
...and the band.

318
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:26,565
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

319
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:30,709
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

320
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,238
Who gave you that hickey?

321
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,710
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

322
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:41,784
I can't believe it!
I can't believe this!

323
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:46,483
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

324
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,757
...and you're partying
and having fun and all:

325
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:54,092
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

326
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:00,331
Don't blame us.
You could've been there.

327
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:04,442
What? As part of your
"poor friends outreach program"?

328
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:06,674
Oh, great. It's work.

329
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:10,577
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry we make more than you.

330
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,912
But we're not gonna feel guilty.
We work really hard.

331
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,788
And we don't work hard?

332
00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:17,616
It's Monica. I got a page.

333
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:21,817
It's just that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

334
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,122
And you feel like we hold you back.

335
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,161
Leon, wait.

336
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:32,201
Guys!

337
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,266
I don't understand.

338
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,635
The steaks were a gift
from the meat vendor.

339
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:38,606
That was not a kickback.

340
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:42,479
I'll just replace them,
and we can forget the whole thing.

341
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:46,646
What corporate policy?

342
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,128
I just got fired.

343
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,635
Here's your check. That'll be $4. 1 2.

344
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:12,071
Let me get that.

345
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:17,074
You got 5 bucks?

346
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,526
Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.

347
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:32,656
Hi, it's me.

348
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:38,896
Listen, Bob.
I'm probably way out of line here.

349
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:42,940
It's been three years, and you 're
probably seeing someone else now...

350
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:47,011
...but if we could have one night
together, for old time 's sake....

351
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:49,876
One hot, steamy, wild night....
