1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,029
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,537
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:10,341
How was the party?

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:14,045
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,477
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,681
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,615
I go through the same thing.

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,984
When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,658
I've put on weight?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,934
Did you want to...?

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,370
No, not weight.
More like insulation.

12
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,773
I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,672
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,277
I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

15
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,383
Please?

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,712
Come on, let her do it!

17
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:55,785
All right.

18
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,153
If we put on spandex and my boobs
are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

19
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,820
Your boobs are fine.

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,552
I shouldn't have said anything.

21
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,822
Come here. Come here!

22
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,499
Can't make hands meet!

23
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,300
The One Where Ross Finds Out

24
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,182
Let's do it!

25
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:15,059
What?

26
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:19,000
Nothing. Just never seen
your little stretchy pants before.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,836
It's cute!

28
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,701
And we're changing.

29
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,610
Come on, give me five more!

30
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:43,752
Five more!

31
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,750
Five more and I'll flash you.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,450
One...

33
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,192
...two...

34
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,128
...two and a half.

35
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:58,897
Just show me one of them.

36
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,810
She's insane!

37
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,114
The woman is insane.

38
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,952
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,425
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

40
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,622
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

41
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,622
Just tell her you want to stop.

42
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:32,622
I can't. All she get to work is all she can got.

43
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:37,068
So that's why we think maybe we should all picking and buy her own resterant.

44
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,468
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?

45
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,934
It was nice. Took him
to a romantic restaurant...

46
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,073
...ordered champagne. Nice.

47
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,004
He still won't put out?

48
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,074
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

49
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,437
Sorry, Pheebs.

50
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,114
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

51
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:56,579
I like him a lot.

52
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,879
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

53
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,989
Why won't he give it up?

54
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:06,355
Maybe he drives his car
on the other side of the road.

55
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,426
If you know what I mean.

56
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:12,429
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

57
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:16,995
Maybe he's gay.

58
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,533
I don't think that's the problem.

59
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,675
We went dancing
the other night...

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,112
...and just the way he held me so close
and looked into my eyes....

61
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:30,785
I just definitely felt something.

62
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,386
But how much can you
tell from a look?

63
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,523
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

64
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:41,696
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

65
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,357
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

66
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,071
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

67
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,238
What?

68
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,833
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

69
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,509
You have a date?

70
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,645
Monica's setting me up.

71
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,574
What about Ross and....

72
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,151
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

73
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:07,879
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

74
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:10,318
... I've decided to opt for sanity.

75
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,550
You're okay about all this?

76
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,990
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

77
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,889
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

78
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:22,865
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

79
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,837
Hi, guys.

80
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:30,171
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

81
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,078
If you say his full name.

82
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:38,051
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

83
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:40,587
All right.

84
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,556
-You're getting a cat?
-Actually, we're getting a cat.

85
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,692
Together?

86
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,920
Both of you? Together?

87
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:52,690
It'll live with Ross half the time
and with me half the time.

88
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:56,035
Well, isn't that just lovely?

89
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,131
That's something you'll enjoy...

90
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,899
...for a really, really,
really long time.

91
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,578
Hopefully.

92
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:07,243
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

93
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,940
With a man.

94
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:12,282
You guys have a really good night...

95
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:16,491
...and you two have a really good cat.

96
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:23,254
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

97
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:35,267
I don't know if Monica told you, but
this my first date since my divorce.

98
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,578
If I seem a little nervous...

99
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:38,905
... I am.

100
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,315
How long do cats live?

101
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:44,082
I'm sorry?

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,311
Cats. How long do they live?

103
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,455
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

104
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,758
Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.

105
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,294
Well, that's just great.

106
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,197
Cheers!

107
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,095
Right. Clink.

108
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:10,541
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

109
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:16,049
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just....

110
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,184
It's this thing.

111
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,217
It's not as bad as it sounds...

112
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:24,153
... but this friend of mine is
getting a cat with his girlfriend.

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,328
Oh, that does sound....

114
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:31,864
He just started going out with her.

115
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:35,530
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

116
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,638
Yeah, he wishes.

117
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,743
I'm sorry. Look at me.

118
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:47,381
Michael, let's talk about you.

119
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:51,985
So....

120
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,382
Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

121
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:01,994
-So I figured it out.
-What?

122
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,392
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

123
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,031
I'm not sexy enough.

124
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,534
Phoebe, that's crazy.

125
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,435
When I first met you,
you know what I said?

126
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,735
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

127
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,575
Really? That's so sweet.

128
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:26,848
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

129
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,721
If you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

130
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,529
You're right. You're right.

131
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,397
You are so "yum"!

132
00:08:56,652 --> 00:09:00,588
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

133
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:05,457
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.

134
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,788
Those things that live for a day.

135
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,964
What are they called?

136
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,797
Fruit flies?

137
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:14,633
Thank you.

138
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:17,065
Would you like dessert?

139
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,470
No dessert.

140
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,969
Just the check. Please.

141
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,810
Oh, no. You're not
having fun, are you?

142
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,639
No, no, I am.

143
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:31,649
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

144
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,787
Oh, look at me.

145
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,349
Look at me.

146
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,153
I'm on a date
with a really great guy.

147
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,659
All I can think about is Ross...

148
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,832
...and his cat...

149
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,467
...and his Julie.

150
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:51,467
Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?

151
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:58,467
Do like that man, I just screwed this all over.

152
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:02,130
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

153
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:07,876
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

154
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:10,809
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure

155
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,777
Closure!

156
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:16,210
That's what it is!
That's what I need!

157
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:18,319
God, you're brilliant!

158
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:22,690
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

159
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,531
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just....

160
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,860
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

161
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,196
"I'm over you."

162
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:36,071
Over you.

163
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,204
That's what it is.

164
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:39,974
Closure.

165
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,477
Hello? Excuse me?

166
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,078
Excuse me. Hel

167
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,112
-Hang on.
-Excuse me?

168
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,014
-What?
-Hi. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:53,554
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

170
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,890
-I'm talking.
-I see that.

171
00:10:56,161 --> 00:11:00,860
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

172
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,724
You're being a little weird
about your phone.

173
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:07,237
All right. Fine.

174
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,533
I'll call you back.

175
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,077
Thank you.

176
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:18,077
So good people!

177
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:24,522
Machine.

178
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:27,787
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.

179
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:32,429
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

180
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:35,258
I'm just calling to say that...

181
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:36,730
...everything's fine.

182
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,203
And I'm really happy for you...

183
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,563
...and your cat.

184
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:46,100
Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

185
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,382
You see there,
I'm thinking of names...

186
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:54,950
...so obviously I am over you.

187
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:58,281
I am over you.

188
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:03,494
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

189
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:24,368
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

190
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,341
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!

191
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,215
It's God's day.

192
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:34,050
If you say stop, then we stop.

193
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,622
Stop.

194
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,826
No, come on! We can't stop!

195
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,961
We got three more pounds to go!

196
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:44,188
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

197
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,879
And how was the date?

198
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,849
I think there was a restaurant.

199
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:10,916
I know there was wine.

200
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,193
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

201
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,594
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....

202
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,428
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

203
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:25,063
I'm sorry. I don't know, l....

204
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:27,905
I feel like I dreamed
about you last night...

205
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:29,438
... but I don't remember.

206
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:36,341
There they are.

207
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:39,282
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

208
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:41,920
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

209
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:47,559
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

210
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,525
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

211
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,360
Rach, I got a message from you!

212
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:01,434
Who's Michael?

213
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,870
Oh, my God!

214
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:06,205
Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

215
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,914
Give me the

216
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,619
You're over me?

217
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:20,121
Oh, God!

218
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:22,419
-You're
-Oh, God.

219
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,495
You're over me?

220
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:32,305
When were you...

221
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,099
... under me?

222
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:41,338
Rachel, do you...?

223
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,846
I mean, were you?

224
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,581
What?

225
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,989
Basically...

226
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,453
...Iately, I've....

227
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:57,022
I've sort of had feelings for you.

228
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:03,763
You've had feelings for me?

229
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,030
So? You had feelings for me first!

230
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,442
You know about my
You know I had

231
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,547
You know?

232
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,615
Chandler told me.

233
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,487
When did he? When did he?
When did he?

234
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,215
When you were in China.

235
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:25,956
Meeting Julie.

236
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:30,129
Julie. That's
Oh, God!

237
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:33,961
I need to lie down.

238
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:36,700
No, I'm gonna stand.

239
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,531
I'm gonna stand...

240
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:42,572
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

241
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,707
Now you're over me?

242
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:51,980
Are you over me?

243
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,863
That's Julie.

244
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,425
-Hi, Julie.
-I've got a cab waiting.

245
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,534
I'll be right down!

246
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,006
Wait, so you're going?

247
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:19,906
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

248
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,376
I mean, I've
You know, I've got a cab.

249
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,848
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

250
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:31,215
Cat!

251
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,267
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

252
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:55,139
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

253
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,710
I can't find the remote.

254
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,487
Thank you.

255
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,450
Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

256
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,492
-And?
-And we did.

257
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,460
All right! Way to go!

258
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,998
Yea, me!

259
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,626
So how did it happen?

260
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:19,668
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

261
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,134
What did he say?

262
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,641
He understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

263
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:28,905
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all:

264
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,813
"ls he gonna call me the next day?"
and "Where is this going?"

265
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,654
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

266
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:44,423
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

267
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,261
Sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

268
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:54,304
If he wants to see me again, he can
call. If not, that's fine too.

269
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,944
So after a lot of talking...

270
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:02,114
... I convinced him.

271
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,548
Let me get this straight.

272
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:10,723
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

273
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:13,551
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

274
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,456
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

275
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,631
This man is my god!

276
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:34,588
This one is cute. Don't you think.

277
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:38,146
Yeah. This one is cute, that one is cute, and they are all cute.

278
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,203
Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.

279
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:46,760
-Are you OK!
-yeah, me, sure!

280
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:55,417
You know this is the big step for us, 
but I'm got feeling that will be OK.

281
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:59,774
I know, I know!

282
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,131
Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.

283
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,488
Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.

284
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:12,446
See, we should work that out before we came down here.

285
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:20,203
I will get a little narrow down with this one over here and this one with the stricks. You pick!

286
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:25,560
-I have to pick?
-whickever one you want.

287
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,617
I don't know.I mean it's not easy to choose.

288
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:46,274
You know both cat are beautiful,funny.
You will be happy with either cat.

289
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,631
Do you want to take both?

290
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:58,988
I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.

291
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,717
I didn't get a cat.

292
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:21,753
That's interesting.

293
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:25,899
No, it's not "interesting."
It's very, very not interesting.

294
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,036
It's actually 100%
the opposite of interesting.

295
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:30,532
I got it, Ross.

296
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,434
You had no right to say
you had feelings for me.

297
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:37,302
I was doing great with Julie
before I knew!

298
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,443
I was doing great
before I knew about you!

299
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:42,080
You think it's easy
to see you with Julie?

300
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,308
You should've said something before!

301
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:47,817
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?

302
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,613
There was never a good time.

303
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:53,224
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

304
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,391
Not...

305
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,961
...every night.

306
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,333
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

307
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,263
You know, like ltalian guys...

308
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:06,338
...or ex-fiances...

309
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,474
...or ltalian guys.

310
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,806
There was one ltalian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

311
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:17,812
The point is, I don't need
this right now!

312
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:19,747
Okay? It's too late.

313
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,923
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!

314
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,321
You're just gonna put away
your feelings for me?

315
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:29,156
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.

316
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,830
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.

317
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,361
I don't need your ship!

318
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:34,465
-Good.
-Good!

319
00:21:36,204 --> 00:21:39,139
And you know what?
Now I got closure!

320
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,316
Try the bottom one.

321
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:03,692
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

322
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:06,621
We're not working out.
It's over.

323
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:09,530
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

324
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,496
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

325
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:16,603
I don't mind the last pound.

326
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:19,501
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

327
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:23,471
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

328
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,170
What you gonna do, fat boy?

329
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:28,941
What?

330
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:35,346
Nothing. Except tell you it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

331
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,452
Well, thanks.

332
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,187
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

333
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:48,769
You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

334
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:56,466
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

335
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:00,141
Well, no. But l....

336
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:04,074
If it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

337
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:12,917
You know, I try to stay positive.

338
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:14,892
So you....

339
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,999
You feel like going for a run?

340
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,169
All right.

341
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:27,475
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
