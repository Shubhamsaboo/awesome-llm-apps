1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,082
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,179
Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.

3
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:10,437
Every time he tried to tell her,
something got in the way...

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,529
...Iike cats, Italian guys.

5
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:15,922
And finally, Chandler was,
like, "Forget about her."

6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:20,762
When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

7
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,818
She was, like, "Oh, my God!"

8
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,845
So she went to the airport to meet him.

9
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,710
She didn 't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,651
That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

11
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:36,097
But enough about us.
How have you been?

12
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,126
The One With Ross' New Girlfriend

13
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:24,331
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

14
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:31,804
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,783
Oh, my God!

16
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,064
Excuse me.

17
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:37,877
Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

18
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,523
Excuse me, excuse me.

19
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:49,815
There you are!

20
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:55,206
So, so....

21
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:58,226
How was China? You!

22
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,942
It was great.

23
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,115
What happened?

24
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,815
-You're bleeding.
-I am?

25
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:05,934
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

26
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,618
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

27
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:12,602
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

28
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,654
Well, where do I start?

29
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,815
This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

30
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:25,881
These are....

31
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:27,180
These are...

32
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:28,555
...aren't for you.

33
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:31,749
These are for you.

34
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,894
Welcome to our country.

35
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,259
Thank you. I'm from New York.

36
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:45,315
No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

37
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:49,409
Baggage claim?

38
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:01,029
I'm telling U.She went to the airport, 
and she's gonna go for it with Ross.

39
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:04,839
Oh, my God! This is huge!

40
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:07,718
This is bigger than huge.
This is....

41
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,227
All right, what's bigger than huge?

42
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,044
This?

43
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,180
Guys, you got new haircuts!

44
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:19,494
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

45
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:24,245
Because, you know, "lf you don't
look good, we don't look good."

46
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,219
I love that voice!

47
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,558
And the winner is Eva Godna!

48
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,048
Airport. Airport. Ross.

49
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:38,653
Not alone.

50
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:39,897
Julie.

51
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,281
Arm around her!

52
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:46,230
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

53
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:49,020
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

54
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,216
Quick, get the verbs.

55
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,621
You! You!

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,856
You said he liked me!

57
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,058
You!

58
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,685
You slowpokes!

59
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:02,513
That's all right.
We got the bags.

60
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,843
This is my sister, Monica.

61
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:09,845
This is Chandler.

62
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,106
Phoebe, hi.

63
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,400
Joey.

64
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,901
Everyone, this is Julie.

65
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:17,004
Julie.

66
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:25,233
But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

67
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:29,365
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

68
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,756
-And bus.
-Oh, my God!

69
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,086
-With the screaming guy
-And the spitting.

70
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,884
You gotta hear this story.

71
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,490
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

72
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,985
Two hundred, at least.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,055
And the chicken poops in her lap!

74
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:51,013
I'm so sorry.

75
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,339
I just gave away the ending, didn't l?

76
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:55,878
I just heard this story in the cab...

77
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:59,804
...and it is all I can think about.

78
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:03,639
This is amazing.

79
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,295
How did this happen?

80
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,130
We were in grad school together.

81
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,631
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

82
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,730
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

83
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:15,058
Julie!

84
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:18,127
Isn't that great?

85
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:23,282
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

86
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,375
It's an expression.

87
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,549
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

88
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:33,445
-Then we'll see the baby.
-Then get some sleep.

89
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,618
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

90
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:39,180
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,301
Bye!

92
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,938
-Can I get some coffee?
-Sure.

93
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,413
-Did you talk to him yet?
-No.

94
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,020
Then, no.

95
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:17,438
What the hell happened to you in China?

96
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,693
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

97
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:22,647
I know I was.

98
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:25,863
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

99
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:30,277
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

100
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,100
God?

101
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,974
It was you, pal.

102
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,720
Maybe it was God doing me.

103
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:47,523
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

104
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:49,621
And then I met Julie...

105
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,485
...and we're having a great time.

106
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,675
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

107
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,843
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

108
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,568
Your lemonade.

109
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,830
I didn't order it.

110
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,659
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

111
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,429
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

112
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,623
So what did you find out?

113
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:17,788
He said....

114
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,545
He said....

115
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,373
They're having a great time.

116
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:26,702
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:30,396
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

118
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,466
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

119
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:37,052
...without any outside help whatsoever.

120
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,482
How is that a silver lining?

121
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:43,440
You have to really wanna see it.

122
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:52,088
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

123
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,061
Hey, Pheebs.

124
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,993
You know what I'm thinking?

125
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:03,132
How...

126
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:06,446
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

127
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,567
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

128
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:17,030
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

129
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,832
So what were you thinking?

130
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,570
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

131
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:26,761
No.

132
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,500
Why not?

133
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,862
Because I'm just....

134
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:34,196
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

135
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,336
No, you're not.

136
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,426
I know I'm not, but you are.

137
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:42,140
I was trying to spare your feelings.

138
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:45,269
Hold on.

139
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,466
Ross, Julie for you.

140
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:19,712
Anybody know a good tailor?

141
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,399
You need clothes altered?

142
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:25,039
No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

143
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,091
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

144
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,231
He did my first suit when I was 1 5.

145
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,910
No, wait, 1 6.

146
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,894
No, excuse me, 1 5.

147
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:41,334
All right, when was 1 990?

148
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:46,806
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

149
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:57,547
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

150
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,967
Okay, bye.

151
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,827
That is so sweet.

152
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,744
Okay. No, you hang up.

153
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,232
No, you

154
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:16,029
One, two, three.

155
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,428
You didn't hang up either.

156
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,639
She didn't hang up.

157
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,629
No, you hang up.

158
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,223
You. You.

159
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,888
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

160
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:45,378
Rachel.

161
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,174
I'll just call her back.

162
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:52,370
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

163
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,292
No, you hang up.

164
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:55,718
How did this happen to me?

165
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:59,335
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

166
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:01,840
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

167
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,889
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

168
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,169
...this really great guy
that I can't have.

169
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:12,762
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

170
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:14,328
I know you did.

171
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:21,510
I'm just gonna deal with it.

172
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,612
I gotta get out of here!

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,102
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

174
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,526
You know, I think I was 1 6.

175
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,351
Please, just a little bit off the back.

176
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:51,865
I'm still on "no."

177
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:55,156
Morning.

178
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:58,255
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

179
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,603
No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

180
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,698
What's going on?

181
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,130
I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

182
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:09,108
What stupid thing did you do?

183
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,993
Why don't you just go get dressed...

184
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:21,603
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

185
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:25,426
How did this happen?

186
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,902
I kind of ran into him last night.

187
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,413
-Where?
-At his apartment.

188
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:31,148
Is this juice?

189
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,535
And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

190
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,946
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

191
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,289
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

192
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,839
People do stupid things
when they're upset.

193
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:48,148
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't

194
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,838
But this is about your horrible mistake.

195
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,637
Sorry we're late.

196
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,203
We were....

197
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,410
Well, there was touching.

198
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:12,252
Hey, Ross!

199
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,258
What a....

200
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:17,773
What are you doing here?

201
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:18,940
I do Raquel!

202
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,974
So he's back?

203
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:30,746
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

204
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,429
No, not a problem.

205
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,871
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

206
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:38,519
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

207
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,076
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

208
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,148
... my pants need to be altered.

209
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,806
When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

210
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,771
He'll know what it means.

211
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,927
You sure he'll crack that code?

212
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:04,215
It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

213
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,330
All right.

214
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:11,716
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

215
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,915
...and all Monica about it.

216
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:16,428
I promise.

217
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,201
All right, let's see.

218
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:22,690
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

219
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,031
But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

220
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:42,268
-That's it. I quit.
-What? I didn't say anything!

221
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:46,405
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

222
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,934
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

223
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,341
...doesn't trust a person.

224
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:54,999
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

225
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,833
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

226
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:02,531
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

227
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:05,351
This is how he wears it.

228
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,501
How who wears it?

229
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:09,896
Demi Moore.

230
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:12,944
Demi Moore is not a "he."

231
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:15,792
Well, he was a "he"
in Arthur and in 10.

232
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,362
That's Dudley Moore!

233
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:22,697
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

234
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:26,025
Oh, my God!

235
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,230
Oh, God!

236
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:31,426
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

237
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:32,413
Which one is Demi Moore?

238
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:38,093
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

239
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:39,631
She's got gorgeous hair.

240
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,507
I know!

241
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,137
How long do you want the cuffs?

242
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,885
At least as long as I have the pants.

243
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,024
I just got that.

244
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,536
Now we'll do your inseam.

245
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:33,355
How is she?

246
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,610
It's too soon to tell.

247
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,219
She's resting, which is a good sign.

248
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:42,409
How's the hair?

249
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,914
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

250
00:16:56,263 --> 00:17:00,346
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

251
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,341
Can we see her?

252
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,003
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

253
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:07,669
Ross, you come on in.

254
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,960
Well, how you doing?

255
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:17,956
I'm okay.

256
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:19,188
That bad, huh?

257
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:24,273
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

258
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:26,001
It's one of my gifts.

259
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,025
Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

260
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:38,159
...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

261
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:42,020
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

262
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,250
... 50 feet of crap...

263
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,847
...then me.

264
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,768
Tell Ross how you feel.

265
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:52,062
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

266
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:55,231
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

267
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:58,586
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

268
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,921
I don't know. I don't know.

269
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:04,546
I've been with my share of women.

270
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:08,145
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

271
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,802
But the point is...

272
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:14,969
... I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

273
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:18,559
Really?

274
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,909
Yo, paisan!

275
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,599
Can I talk to you for a sec?

276
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,590
Your tailor...

277
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,160
...is a very bad man!

278
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:42,815
What are you talking about?

279
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:44,919
Hey, what's going on?

280
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,175
Joey's tailor...

281
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,559
...took advantage of me.

282
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:02,251
No way! I've been going
to the guy for 1 2 years.

283
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:04,479
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

284
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,443
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite

285
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:09,612
What?

286
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,169
Cupping.

287
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:17,795
That's how they do pants!

288
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,849
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

289
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:26,180
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

290
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:32,004
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

291
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:34,265
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

292
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,394
What's the matter with you?

293
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,647
What?

294
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:49,082
That's not?

295
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,804
Oh, my God!

296
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:12,546
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

297
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,028
I like it.

298
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,529
I do. I think it's a 10!

299
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,049
Thank you.

300
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,794
My hair is very amused.

301
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,635
Come on, things could be worse.

302
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:38,199
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

303
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,024
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

304
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,340
Thank you.

305
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,750
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

306
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:50,068
Bye, Rach!

307
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,882
Wait, are you leaving?

308
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,899
That's what I meant by "bye."

309
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,828
Can I talk to you for a sec?

310
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:03,754
When the doctor does
that hernia test....

311
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,996
That's okay.

312
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:18,141
What's going on?

313
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,279
Well, okay, first of all...

314
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,427
... Paolo and I are not back together.

315
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,710
That was a stupid thing I did.

316
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:31,800
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

317
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,187
...well, I wouldn't.

318
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,529
Second of all....

319
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,350
What?

320
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:47,141
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

321
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:48,868
... I tell you what I think...

322
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,524
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

323
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:54,006
...and I look like
a complete idiot?

324
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,407
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

325
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:02,989
I hate him. I mean, I actually
I physically hate him.

326
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,598
I always have.

327
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:09,687
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

328
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:11,574
Really?

329
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:15,084
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

330
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,242
...and who gets how funny...

331
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,986
...and sweet and amazing...

332
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,198
...and adorable and sexy you are.

333
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:27,045
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

334
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:29,997
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

335
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,878
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

336
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,257
Like the way I do with Julie.

337
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:44,422
Was there a "second of all"?

338
00:22:50,062 --> 00:22:53,229
No, I think that was the whole "all."

339
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,579
I gotta go.

340
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:02,853
Thanks.

341
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,932
No, I swear to God, Dad!

342
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:12,398
That's not how they measure pants!

343
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:22,433
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

344
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:25,116
-Yeah, I could do that.
-Really?

345
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:27,119
-You wanna do it now?
-Great!

346
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:30,897
See you.

347
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,777
I just wanna make
really sure this time.

348
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:39,396
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

349
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:41,458
No.

350
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:47,349
That's Roddy McDowall.

351
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,360
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

352
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,316
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
