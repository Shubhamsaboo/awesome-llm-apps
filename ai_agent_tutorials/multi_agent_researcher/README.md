### How it works?

- Once you provide a valid API key, three instances of the Assistant class are created:
    - **story_researcher**: Specializes in researching HackerNews stories.
    - **user_researcher**: Focuses on researching HackerNews users and reading articles from URLs.
    - **hn_assistant**: A team assistant that coordinates the research efforts of the story and user researchers.

- Enter your research query in the provided text input field. This could be a topic, keyword, or specific question related to HackerNews stories or users.
- The hn_assistant will orchestrate the research process by delegating tasks to the story_researcher and user_researcher based on your query.
- The AI assistants will gather relevant information from HackerNews using the provided tools and generate a comprehensive response using the GPT-4 language model.
- The generated content, which could be a blog post, report, or social media post, will be displayed in the app for you to review and use.
