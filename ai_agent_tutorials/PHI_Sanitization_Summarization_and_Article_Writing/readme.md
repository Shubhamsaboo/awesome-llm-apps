## ✨ Features

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Teamwork**: CAMEL-AI + OWL frameworks enable real-time collaboration between autonomous agents.
- **💡 Autonomous Agents**: Agents communicate, collaborate, and validate outputs for accurate results.
- **🔗 Seamless Integration**: CAMEL-AI for agent design + OWL for real-time task management.
- **🌐 Streamlit UI**: A clean, interactive app for easy task execution.
- **🚀 Use Cases**:
  - Summarize medical texts in seconds.
  - Automate research article generation.
  - Sanitize PHI data for compliance.

## 🌐 APIs Used

This project integrates the following APIs to enhance functionality:

- **Chunker API** 
  Processes and segments large input data into manageable chunks, enabling efficient handling of large datasets or documents. Ideal for parallel processing and performance optimization.

- **OpenAI API**  
  Powers the AI models used for natural language processing, text generation, and other intelligent capabilities within the multi-agent system.

- **Firecrawl API**  
  Provides web scraping functionality to collect and process web data dynamically, enabling agents to fetch and analyze up-to-date information from online sources.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Agent Roles**: Defined using CAMEL-AI's `RolePlaying` class.
2. **Dynamic Toolkits**: Integrated CAMEL-AI's tools for agent functionality.
3. **Real-Time Management**: OWL framework ensures smooth task execution.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit provides an intuitive UI for users.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Bipul70701/Multi-Agent-System-OWL.git  
   cd Multi-Agent-System-OWL  
   ```  

2. **Create a virtual environment**:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   ```  

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:  
   - On Windows:  
     ```bash  
     venv\Scripts\activate  
     ```  
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash  
     source venv/bin/activate  
     ```  

4. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

5. **Run the Streamlit app**:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run multiagentsystem.py
   ```
