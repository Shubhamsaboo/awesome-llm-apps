# 🚀 Collaborative Multi-Agent AI System

Welcome to my latest project: a **multi-agent AI platform** that automates complex tasks through teamwork! This system combines the power of **CAMEL-AI**, **OWL**, and **Streamlit** to create a seamless, interactive experience for task automation and collaboration.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Teamwork**: CAMEL-AI + OWL frameworks enable real-time collaboration between autonomous agents.
- **💡 Autonomous Agents**: Agents communicate, collaborate, and validate outputs for accurate results.
- **🔗 Seamless Integration**: CAMEL-AI for agent design + OWL for real-time task management.
- **🌐 Streamlit UI**: A clean, interactive app for easy task execution.
- **🚀 Use Cases**:
  - Summarize medical texts in seconds.
  - Automate research article generation.
  - Sanitize PHI data for compliance.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Agent Roles**: Defined using CAMEL-AI's `RolePlaying` class.
2. **Dynamic Toolkits**: Integrated CAMEL-AI's tools for agent functionality.
3. **Real-Time Management**: OWL framework ensures smooth task execution.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit provides an intuitive UI for users.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Bipul70701/Multi-Agent-System-OWL.git  
   cd Multi-Agent-System-OWL  
   ```  

2. **Create a virtual environment**:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   ```  

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:  
   - On Windows:  
     ```bash  
     venv\Scripts\activate  
     ```  
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash  
     source venv/bin/activate  
     ```  

4. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

5. **Run the Streamlit app**:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```
