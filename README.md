Each project is self-contained with its own `README.md` and `requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the desired project directory**

    ```bash
    cd awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_travel_agent
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Follow the project-specific instructions** in each project's `README.md` file to set up and run the app.

Most projects use **Streamlit** for the UI. After installing dependencies and configuring API keys, you can typically run a project with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Refer to each project's README for specific API key requirements and configuration details.
