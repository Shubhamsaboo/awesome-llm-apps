## 🚀 Getting Started

**New to this repo?** Check out our comprehensive **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** for a complete walkthrough with troubleshooting tips!

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the desired project directory**

    ```bash
    cd awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_travel_agent
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Validate your environment** (optional but recommended)

    ```bash
    python scripts/validate_env.py
    ```

5. **Follow the project-specific instructions** in each project's `README.md` file to set up and run the app.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the system requirements?</strong></summary>

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher is recommended
- **RAM**: At least 8GB for cloud-based LLMs, 16GB+ for running local models
- **GPU**: Only required for local models (Ollama, Llama) - not needed for cloud APIs
- **Storage**: Varies by project; local models require 4-8GB per model

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which project should I start with as a beginner?</strong></summary>

Start with projects in the **🌱 Starter AI Agents** category. Good first projects include:
- [AI Travel Agent](starter_ai_agents/ai_travel_agent/) - Simple and practical
- [AI Data Analysis Agent](starter_ai_agents/ai_data_analysis_agent/) - Great for learning agent basics
- [Basic RAG Chain](rag_tutorials/rag_chain/) - Understand RAG fundamentals

These have clear documentation and minimal setup requirements.

**📖 See our [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) for a complete step-by-step walkthrough!**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need paid API keys to run these apps?</strong></summary>

It depends on the project:
- **Cloud LLMs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google): Require API keys with usage-based pricing
- **Local LLMs** (Ollama, Llama): Free to run but require more computing resources
- Many projects offer both options - look for "Local" variants in the project names

**Tip**: OpenAI and Anthropic offer free trial credits. Google's Gemini API has a generous free tier.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I get API keys for different providers?</strong></summary>

| Provider | Sign Up Link | Free Tier |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| OpenAI | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) | $5 free credit |
| Anthropic | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) | $5 free credit |
| Google (Gemini) | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) | Generous free tier |
| Groq | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) | Free tier available |
| Cohere | [cohere.com](https://cohere.com) | Free tier available |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I run local models instead of cloud APIs?</strong></summary>

1. **Install Ollama**: Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull a model**: `ollama pull llama3.1` or `ollama pull qwen2.5`
3. **Look for local variants**: Many projects have a `*_local.py` file or "Local" in the name
4. Projects in [Local RAG Agent](rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/) and [Llama 3.1 Local RAG](rag_tutorials/llama3.1_local_rag/) are fully local

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between Single Agents, Multi-Agents, and Agent Teams?</strong></summary>

- **Single Agents**: One AI agent handling all tasks (simpler, good for focused use cases)
- **Multi-Agents**: Multiple agents working together on complex tasks
- **Agent Teams**: Specialized multi-agent systems with defined roles (e.g., researcher, writer, reviewer)

Start with single agents, then explore multi-agent patterns as you advance.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is RAG and when should I use it?</strong></summary>

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** enhances LLMs by providing relevant context from your own data.

Use RAG when you want to:
- Query your own documents, PDFs, or databases
- Get accurate answers grounded in specific information
- Reduce hallucinations by providing source material

Explore the [📀 RAG Tutorials](rag_tutorials/) section to get started.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why am I getting API rate limit or quota errors?</strong></summary>

Common causes and solutions:
- **Rate limits**: Add delays between requests or use exponential backoff
- **Quota exceeded**: Check your billing/usage dashboard, upgrade your plan if needed
- **Invalid key**: Verify your API key is correct and has proper permissions
- **Free tier limits**: Some providers limit free tier usage - consider upgrading or switching to local models

</details>
