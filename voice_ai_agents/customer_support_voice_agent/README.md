# üéôÔ∏è Customer Support Voice Agent

An OpenAI SDK powered customer support agent application that delivers voice-powered responses to questions about your knowledge base using OpenAI's GPT-4o and TTS capabilities. The system crawls through documentation websites with Firecrawl, processes the content into a searchable knowledge base with Qdrant, and provides both text and voice responses to user queries.

## Features

- Knowledge Base Creation

  - Crawls documentation websites using Firecrawl
  - Stores and indexes content using Qdrant vector database
  - Generates embeddings for semantic search capabilities using FastEmbed
- **AI Agent Team**
  - **Documentation Processor**: Analyzes documentation content and generates clear, concise responses to user queries
  - **TTS Agent**: Converts text responses into natural-sounding speech with appropriate pacing and emphasis
  - **Voice Customization**: Supports multiple OpenAI TTS voices:
    - alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, verse

- **Interactive Interface**
  - Clean Streamlit UI with sidebar configuration
  - Real-time documentation search and response generation
  - Built-in audio player with download capability
  - Progress indicators for system initialization and query processing
